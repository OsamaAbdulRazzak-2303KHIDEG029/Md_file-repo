Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI for August 2015 clocked in at 1.72% YoY, which stood higher than consensus estimate of 1.40% - 1.50%. The reading allowed 2MFY16 CPI to stand at 1.76% compared to 7.40% in the corresponding period last year. Core inflation remained largely flat at 4.0% YoY, while trimmed core inflation clocked in at 2.8% YoY. Recent reduction in gas and petroleum prices announced by the government will likely allow low inflationary levels to persist and keep the real interest rate at a very comfortable level.

On the balance of payment front, monthly current account deficit fell to USD 159mn in July 2015 as opposed to the revised current account deficit of USD 284mn for June 2015. While the trade deficit rose by a healthy 17% MoM, CSF receipts during July helped keep the current account deficit under control. Faltering export numbers continued to remain under pressure, but the recent depreciation of Pak Rupee against the greenback may provide some support ahead. Things could get sour, however, if regional exporting nations devalue their currencies even further.

With global oil prices trending lower, we believe the current lean interest rate cycle could continue till at least March 2016. Although another cut in the discount rate cannot be completely ruled out, the central bank may not give in to allure owing to the prevalent pressure on the Pak Rupee.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The recent currency devaluation undertaken by exporting nations to counter possible future US Fed rate hike led to depreciation of the PKR against the USD by 2.1% primarily due to foreign portfolio selling and regional currency devaluation. In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After peaking to an all-time high of 36,228 points in early August, the KSE-100 index fell by 4.1% to 34,726 on account of currency devaluations across emerging markets, and the resultant regional equity downturn. The devaluations compelled foreign investors to divest to protect gains and stave off currency losses in emerging and frontier markets. Foreign selling was witnessed on the local bourse too, which was primarily absorbed by local Banks/DFIs. Foreign outflow stood at USD 61mn over August, which brings the net FIPI outflow to USD 157mn for the entire 8MCY15 period. Significant support was shown by Banks/DFIs (+USD 45mn) and Companies (+USD 17mn). Volumes at the bourse (KSE-100) also dipped by 14% MoM to 161mn shares in August, while value traded declined by 8% to PKR 10.6bn.

OGDC, MCB, & UBL contributed the most to the index slump during August, while KAPCO saw the biggest positive contribution among the KSE-100 index companies. Sector wise return shows Telecom, Oil & Gas and Banks underperformed the most amongst key sectors, while Pharmaceuticals and Electricity sector fared well.

Going forward, US monetary policy in September, emerging market developments and foreign portfolio flows will be key developments to watch out for. Pakistan’s inclusion in MSCI emerging market index could also shape future market direction.
