Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report August 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing remained subdued in June taking FY19 relevant index down by 3.64% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across all sectors with food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, iron and steel products and autos leading the decline. An important development occurred as base year for the CPI calculation was changed from 2007-08 to 2015-16. Using the new base year, Inflation for the month of Aug’19 clocked in at 10.5% whereas the inflation stood at 11.6% using the old base year due to rise in utility tariffs coupled with rising petrol prices. Rupee appreciated slightly by 1.9% against USD through the month.

Pakistan seems to be in low GDP growth phase where FY19 GDP growth clocked in around 3.3%, but will fall further in FY20 at 2.4%, according to IMF estimates. Fiscal position remained worrisome, however, foreign exchange reserves increased by ~USD 558mn during the month to close at USD15.6bn as of 30 August 2019. This was on the back of receipt of the first tranche of USD 990mn from the IMF in July. The reserves are expected to increase going forward as lending from other development institutions follow the bailout. Current Account deficit for the month of July'19 came in at USD 579mn down by 73% SPLY. In contrast, FY19 CAD stood at USD 13.5bn. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Consequently, we expect further improvement in the current account. Exports during July’19 showed considerable improvement and increased by 11%, Moreover, we believe that an FTA with China can lead to a significant increase in textile exports for Pakistan going forward. Furthermore, foreign remittances depicted an increase of 2.9% YoY for the outgoing month.

During next month, the SBP is expected to maintain the discount rate at current level due to the lower than expected inflation number for August, signalling a peak of the monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate dependent upon any inflationary shock going forward. Market activity seems to be depressed on the back of the CNIC condition imposed in the FY20 budget as retailers remain resistant to registering themselves. Any further positive development on this front is vital to the revival of economy.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of August, market continued its momentum shift as set in the last monetary policy statement in anticipation of stable economic environment, as most of the adjustments in interest rates have been done. This paradigm shift formed an inverted yield curve where most of the interest is now long term instruments resulting in heavy demand which pushed yield of longer tenor securities further downwards.

In the most recent T-bill auction, SBP witnessed total participation of PKR 858 billion out of which SBP accepted bids worth PKR 676 billion of which PKR 152 billion was witnessed in 3-Months, PKR 700 million in 6-Months and PKR 523 billion in 12-Months. Cutoffs for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month were 13.75%, 13.94% and 14.24% respectively.

Auction for fixed bonds witnessed an overwhelming response; the auction had a maturity of PKR 9 billion against a target of PKR 100 billion. SBP witnessed a total participation of PKR 1.034 trillion out of which PKR 414 billion in 3 year, PKR 55 billion in 5 year and PKR 25 billion in 10 year were accepted at 14.25%, 13.55% and 13.14% respectively. Auction for floating bond witnessed a total participation of PKR 47 billion out of which PKR 41 billion was accepted at a cutoff rate of 75 bps over 6 months T-bill weighted average yield.

Going forward, we believe that market may continue its positive momentum in the coming month. However, any unexpected change in inflationary numbers will be critical in setting the direction of the market.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index closed negative for seventh consecutive month in August, closing -7.10% down at 29,672 points. Average daily turnover in August 2019 came in at 84.1mn which was significantly higher than previous month’s level of 61.7 mn. During August, the net foreign outflow amounted to US$ 3.52 as compared to a net foreign inflow of US$ 30.4mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in cements (US$ 2.1mn) and Technology (US $1.2mn) while they remained net sellers in Oil and Gas exploration companies (US$ 4.8mn) and fertilizers (US$ 2.2mn).

At the start of the month, India abolished article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. Therefore, the index remained under pressure during the month as concerns regarding Pak-India tension over Kashmir, weakening economy, precarious external reserves position and persistent current account deficit weighed down on the investor sentiments. Also, the government continued meetings with various stakeholders regarding the measures taken in FY20 budget regarding increase in tax collection (a record target of PKR 5.5tn has been set) and discouraging the informal economy. Due to these measures it is anticipated that economic growth will likely slowdown in the upcoming year which further dampened investor sentiment for equities investments.

On a monthly basis, oil and gas exploration companies contributed the largest to the decline with 827 points, amid foreign selling, followed by commercial banks with 755 points. Oil and Gas Marketing companies followed suit contributing 230 points to the decline due to shrinking industry volumes and margins.
