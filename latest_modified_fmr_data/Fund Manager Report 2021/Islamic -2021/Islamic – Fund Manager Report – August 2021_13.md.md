## Sindh Workers' Welfare Fund (SWWF)

During the month of August 2021, provisioning against Sindh Workersâ€™ Welfare Fund by Alfalah GHP Islamic Value Fund (AGIVF) amounting to Rs. 3.735 million has been reversed on the clarification received by Sindh Revenue Board vide letter No. SRB/TP/70/2013/8772 dated August 12, 2021 addressed to Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan.
