# Alfalah Asset Management Limited Fund Managers' Report April 2025

Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Inflation numbers continued to show marked improvement in April 2025, with headline CPI registering a modest increase of just 0.28% MoM, followed by a 0.69% increase in March. Core inflation also decelerated to 8.0% compared to 9.0% a month earlier. In the coming months, some upward pressure is expected on the back of low base effect; the full-year CPI is projected to average 4-5% in FY25.

Supporting this disinflationary environment, the external account has shown resilience. Pakistan recorded a current account surplus of USD 1.19 billion in the month of March, supported by better remittances recording a 30% increase MoM, taking the 9MFY25 current account surplus number to USD 1.86 billion.

However, pressure on external reserves remained visible. The State Bank of Pakistan’s foreign exchange reserves declined by approximately USD 400 million in April, closing the month at USD 10.2 billion, primarily due to the retirement of external debt. The Pakistani rupee also saw a marginal depreciation of 0.3% against the US dollar, closing at PKR 281.0.

On the fiscal front, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) reported tax collections of PKR 9,299 billion during the first ten months of FY25—reflecting a solid 26.5% YoY growth. Nonetheless, the collection figure fell short of the target by PKR 831 billion, highlighting the ongoing challenge of revenue underperformance amidst a fragile economic recovery.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the recent monetary policy meeting on 05 May 2025, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reduced the policy rate by 100 basis points, bringing the policy rate to 11.0%. The cumulative monetary easing since June 2024 has been recorded to a substantial 1,100 basis points. The decision was underpinned by a sustained deceleration in inflation, with headline CPI and core inflation both showing meaningful declines.

Separately, in the fixed-rate Pakistan Investment Bond (PIB) auction held on April 9, 2025, the SBP accepted a total of PKR 428 billion against a target of PKR 350 billion. Accepted bids included PKR 42 billion in 2-year, PKR 39 billion in 3-year, PKR 99 billion in 5-year, and PKR 248 billion in 10-year instruments. The cut-off yields settled at 11.94%, 11.88%, 12.34%, and 12.79%, respectively, signaling continued investor interest across the yield curve in a softening interest rate environment.

In the Treasury bill auction conducted on April 30, 2025, the SBP faced maturities of PKR 698 billion against a target of PKR 400 billion. The central bank accepted bids totaling PKR 527 billion, distributed across various tenors: PKR 65 billion in 1-month, PKR 148 billion in 3-month, PKR 94 billion in 6-month, and PKR 220 billion in 12-month papers. Cut-off yields were set at 12.15%, 12.00%, 12.00%, and 12.01%, respectively.

Looking ahead, stability in the local currency and a favorable base effect are expected to support the inflation outlook, with price levels likely to remain in low single digits over the coming months, albeit with a mild uptick toward the end of the fiscal year. Given the significant monetary easing already in place, the central bank may opt to pause further rate cuts to assess the economic impact of previous reductions.

Our base-case scenario suggests that interest rates will remain stable in the near term, barring any unexpected changes in macroeconomic conditions. However, if key economic indicators surpass expectations, there remains potential for an additional 100 bps rate cut in the coming months.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index recorded its steepest monthly drop since August 2023, closing at 111,327 after shedding 6,480 points (-5.5% MoM). The slide was driven primarily by global risk-off sentiment, initially sparked by U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of sweeping trade tariffs. While a temporary 90-day suspension (excluding China) provided brief respite, sentiment quickly deteriorated again as geopolitical tensions between Pakistan and India resurfaced toward month-end.

Despite heightened volatility in April, the equity market witnessed a notable pickup in investor participation post-Ramzan. Average daily traded volume surged by 41.7% MoM to 518 million shares, while traded value rose 31.2% MoM to USD 112.5 million, indicating a partial revival of market interest.

Sector performance was mixed. The heaviest drags on the index came from Exploration & Production (-2,518 points), Fertilizer (-1,425 points), and Investment Companies (-998 points). In contrast, Commercial Banks (+1,071 points) and Cement (+253 points) offered limited support.

Investor flows reflected caution. Foreign investors remained net sellers, registering outflows of USD 9.5 million. Among local institutions, insurance companies booked USD 45 million in net outflows, while corporates and other institutions helped offset selling pressure, posting combined inflows of USD 48.6 million.

Despite short-term headwinds, market valuations remain attractive. The benchmark KSE-100 is trading at a forward P/E of 5.9x, well below its historical average. Looking ahead, the upcoming FY26 federal budget will be a key driver of market sentiment as investors assess fiscal direction and macroeconomic priorities.
