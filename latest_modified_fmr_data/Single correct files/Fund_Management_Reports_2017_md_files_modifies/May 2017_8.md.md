Fund Managers' Report May 2017

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy grew at a rate of 5.3% in FY17, the highest rate in ten years. The biggest contribution came from the services sector, which grew by 5.98%, followed by Industrials sector (5.02%) and Agricultural sector (3.46%). The country’s current account deficit continued to raise concerns, with 10MFY17 CA deficit widening by 205% to reach USD 7.2 bn (2.6% of GDP) primarily on the back of increasing trade deficit (higher imports and depressed exports). Lower remittances and absence of CSF inflows widened the CA deficit in April-2017.

Furthermore, the remittances for the month of April-2017 were USD 1.5 billion (-7% YoY), taking cumulative 10MFY17 remittances to USD 15.6 billion (-2.7% YoY). Additionally, the country’s foreign exchange reserves remained over USD 21bn during the month, signaling stability in the external position.

Inflation in the economy has started to pick up, CPI inflation in May 2017 clocked in at 5.01% vs. 4.78% in April 2017. The slight rise in inflation could be attributed to a low base effect as the sequential rise remained minimal (0.01% MoM in May-2017 vs. 1.4% MoM in April 2017).

The USD/PKR Parity remained flat at PKR 104.8 during May 2017. Due to higher government spending on development projects, greater energy availability, and low cost of production are likely to improve the economy in the coming months. However, threats to the external position curtails from a rise in international crude oil prices, declining growth of remittances, uptick in imports owing to economic stability and CPEC projects, more over lack of proper policy implementation to rejuvenate exports, could further stretch current account deficit which might risk the reserve balances.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Money market remained relatively stable as the cutoffs for both the T-bills and PIB were maintained thus showing little to no change in yields. SBP conducted two T-bill auctions with a cumulative target of PKR 750bn against the maturity of PKR 717bn. SBP maintained the yields for 3M at 5.99%, 6M at 6.01% and 2bps upward change in yield in 12M at 6.04%. Major participation though out the T-bill auction was witnessed in 3M T-bill followed by 6M and 12M thus maintaining the trend of investing in shorter term T-bill.

The result of PIB auction held on 17th May 2017 also showed a stagnant trend as the cutoff for 3y, 5y and 10y were maintained at 6.40%, 6.89% and 7.93% respectively. Target for the auction amounted to PKR 50bn out of which only PKR 40bn was accepted.

State bank released the auction calendar for the period of May to July 2017, where the government targets to borrow PKR 2.65 trillion through T-bill and PKR 200bn via PIBs against the maturity of PKR 2.4 trillion and PKR 698bn respectively indicating a higher than the required borrowing throughout the period.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The equity market experienced extreme fluctuations in the month of May, with the KSE-100 index gaining over 3,300 points before the budget, and then trimming more than half of those gains to close the month with gains of only around 1,300 points. The positive momentum in the start before the pivoting budgeting was due to both positive expectations from the budget as well as the upgrade of Pakistan to Emerging Market status beginning June 1, 2017. However, the correction by the month end was due to negative implications of certain harsh taxation measures introduced in the budget as well as non-materialization of net-inflow of foreign funds.

The FIPI continued to remain on a negative route during May 2017 (USD 188 mn) while mutual funds remained the largest net buyers (USD 1573 million). In terms of stocks performance OGDC remained the major contributor in May 2017 with +239 points, whereas UBL turned out to be a weak performer in the month (-61 points).

In terms of sector-wise performance Oil & Gas were the top performers by posting a positive return of 10.3% in anticipation of extending oil supply cuts in OPEC's May'17 meet. Following on, Textiles (+3.3% MoM on anticipation of refund payments in budget), Chemicals (+1.7% on positive budgetary implications) along with Commercial Banks (+1.2% on MSCI EM inclusion) also ended in green. The weak performing sectors included Cements (-4.6% MoM on anticipated slowdown in dispatches in Ramadan) and Automobiles (-1.8% MoM on profit taking post a stellar run-up in Apr'17). The market is expected to recover in June as it had fallen to attractive levels towards the end of May. The most important event ahead is the conclusion of JIT’s investigation against the Prime Minister in the Panama Case.
