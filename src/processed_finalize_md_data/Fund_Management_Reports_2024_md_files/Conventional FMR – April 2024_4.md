Fund Managers' Report April 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

In the first nine months of FY24, the Current Account recorded a deficit of US$508 mn, showcasing a substantial improvement from the deficit of US$4.05 bn during the same period last year, marking a 87% decrease. In March 2024, the Current Account reported a surplus of US$619 mn, compared to a surplus of US$537 mn during the same period last year. The improvement in CAD can be attributed to a 31% Month-on-Month higher remittances, a seasonal uptick usually witnessed in Ramadan Month. Remittances during the Month rebounded to 2-year high at 2.954 billion this month.

Foreign exchange reserves saw a slight increase to US$13.431 bn by April 26, 2024, compared to US$13.38 bn at the end of March 2024. The Pakistani Rupee (PKR) has remained relatively stable, averaging at 278.2 for the month of April.

Inflation for the month of April stood at 17.3%, marking a notable decline compared to March 2024's reported inflation of 20.70%, taking real interest rates into positive trajectory. This decrease can be primarily attributed to the higher base effect and currency stabilization due to favorable macro indicators.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent elevated levels. Monetary easing is expected to begin in the upcoming MPC, potentially resulting in a reduction of 6%-8% in the policy rate over the next Fiscal year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program, volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict remain significant risk to our forecasted rate cuts this extent.

The new government has demonstrated a clear focus on economic reforms and successfully concluded the second review of current Stand-By Agreement (SBA) leading to an immediate disbursement of USD 1.1 Billion. Talks are underway for a more extensive assistance package with IMF and IMF mission is likely to visit Pakistan in Mid May 2024 to finalize the features of the upcoming bailout package under the USD 6-8 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. Moreover, the anticipated new IMF program is expected to establish a framework for financial support from multilateral agencies. This support will be instrumental in addressing the external account challenges that the country is projected to encounter in the next three years, particularly due to substantial debt repayments.

On a positive note, the SIFC platform is anticipated to attract significant investments from Saudi Arabia, China, and the UAE over the next 2-5 years. This has the potential to be a substantial positive development for the country, especially if agreements related to these investments are signed in the near future.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of April clocked in at 17.3% which declined significantly compared to March 2024. Food segment remained the major contributor to decrease in monthly change, while other segments relatively remained flat as well on MoM basis. Overall, CPI witnessed declining trend on MoM basis. Major decline witnessed in perishable food items on MoM basis such as tomatoes and onions due to price normalization after Ramadan uptick and bumper crops in FY24. Overall, Year-on-Year inflation hit a 22-month low marking the instance of positive real interest rate since December 2020 and open room for SBP to cut interest rate going forward.

Secondary market yield witnessed declining trend prior to monetary policy announcements as market started pricing in increase expectation of interest rate cuts due to positive indicators such as considerable improvement in both inflation readings and external position. However, yields reversed after MPC maintained status quo the monetary policy held on April 29, 2024 and suggested maintaining the current monetary stance for now in order to bring inflation down to the target range of 5-7%.

SBP held three T-Bill auctions this month with a target of PKR 1,050 billion against the maturity of PKR 469 billion. In the first auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 496 billion at a cut-off yield of 21.66%, 21.40% and 20.90% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the Second auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 538 billion at a cut-off yield of 21.66%, 21.39%, and 20.90% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the Third auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 253 billion at a cut-off yield of 21.66%, 21.38%, and 20.90% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the PIB auction, bids worth Rs. 6.8 billion were accepted for 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year tenures at cut-off yields of 16.65%, 15.48%, and 14.35% respectively. However, no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years & 30-years tenures.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent elevated levels and remained below 15% on a consistent basis due to stability in currency along with favorable base effect. Monetary easing is expected to begin in upcoming Monetary policy scheduled on 10-June-2024, potentially resulting in a reduction of 6%-8% in the policy rate over the next Fiscal year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program, volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict remain significant risk to our forecasted rate cuts this extent.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Continuing its upward trajectory, the Benchmark index reached record high levels of 72,764 on 26th April 2024, closing the month with the index reaching a level of 71,102, marking a return of 6.12% for the month of April 2024. The market maintained a positive outlook due to the new government's economic reforms, lower inflation figures, unchanged policy rate, and a favorable stance towards the IMF program. Average daily volume experienced surge of 49% on monthly basis, clocking at 243.551 million compared to the previous month's average level of 163.95 million.

Foreign investors once again remained prominent, with a net foreign inflow of US$48.21 million, compared to last month inflow of US $15.3 million. Foreign buying was predominantly concentrated in Commercial Banks, Fertilizer and in Oil and Gas Exploration sectors. Moreover, Commercial Banks emerged as the top performing sectors during the month, contributing 1,385 points, whereas Fertilizer, Oil, and Gas Exploration contributed 1,124 & 642 Points respectively.

During the meeting on April 29th, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) made the decision to maintain the status quo on the policy rate. The MPC underscored the significance of the forthcoming Federal budget and the introduction of a new IMF program as crucial determinants shaping the trajectory of monetary policy.

The new government's strong commitment to economic reforms, adherence to the IMF program, and focus on fiscal consolidation have instilled confidence among investors in both the economy and the stock market. Approval has been granted by the IMF Executive Board for the disbursement of the final portion, valued at US$1.1 billion, of Pakistan's US$3 billion SBA.

Going forward, inflation is expected to soften a bit from its high levels due to higher base effect and is expected to fall below 18% from July and onwards. However, the uncertain impact of increased utility tariffs and international oil prices may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.
