December, 2014

Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for December 2014 clocked in at 4.3% YoY, bringing inflation for the first six months of the fiscal year (i.e. 1HFY15) down to 6.1% against 8.9% in corresponding period last year. With the IMF calling for a positive real interest rate, we feel the stage is set for up to 100bps monetary easing in 2HFY15, where we eye a minimum 50bps cut in the upcoming monetary policy review.

Current account deficit for the month of November clocked in at USD0.47bn versus a revised deficit of USD0.22bn in October. Imports fell more than exports over the month, resulting in a 20% MoM decline in trade deficit numbers. 5MFY15 current account deficit now stands at USD2.3bn as opposed to USD2.1bn witnessed in the CPLY.

The State Bank of Pakistan’s forex reserves have witnessed a remarkable turnaround in CY14, rising from a paltry USD3bn in Jan-14 to USD10bn in Dec-14. Total forex reserves have crossed the USD15bn mark, a level last witnessed more than two years back. The steep fall in crude oil prices, we believe, will be fully visible by the end of 3QFY15 (Mar’15), at which point the current account may start posting monthly surplus.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Subsequent to the cut in discount rate back in November, PIB cut-offs inched lower in the auction held on December 24, 2014. All three major tenors, i.e. 3Y, 5Y and 10Y, lost 30bps in the primary market, and fell much more in the secondary market. The 5Y PIB lost a monumental 103bps in secondary trading over the month – falling from 10.88% to 9.85%. The 10Y PIB and the 3Y PIB lost 101bps and 86bps to close at 10.64% and 9.59%, respectively.

The central bank observed a whopping participation of PKR 338bn in the PIB auction and accepted PKR 155bn (against targeted PKR 50bn). FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions.

Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh injections with a colossal participation of PKR 2,199bn – toppling November as the month with the highest participation over FY15 to date. The SBP accepted PKR 2,148bn (98% acceptance ratio) to support the market. Five mop-ups were also conducted in December with participation of PKR 1,575bn and acceptance of PKR 1,524bn (97%).

The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. After touching a multi-year low of 3.96% in November, inflation for December clocked in at 4.3%. With commodity prices continuing their sharp descent, we expect further price easing within the local economic environment. This should keep inflation in check and allow for further monetary easing of 100-150bps over FY15.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market ended December 2014 on a positive note, generating a decent return of 3% for the month. The KSE-100 index also closed at its all-time high of 32,100 points. The rally was led by an 11-year low monthly CPI reading of 3.96% for November and rise in forex reserves; which has also strengthened the case for monetary easing in Jan’15.

Cements, Electricity and Food Producers outperformed the benchmark while Pharma and Oil & Gas closed in the red. After two years of extraordinary performance by the KSE-100 index (49% p.a return), the market clocked in a return of 27% in CY14, which is still handsome considering the rise in political noise.

Sliding crude oil prices have been a boon for the economy as they have and will continue to result in lower imports, and by extension lower current account deficit. Going forward, lower crude oil prices will lift valuation attraction for listed industrial concerns and sectors that use the fuel as a raw material. In this regard, Textiles, Paper & Board and Glass industries should post stronger results on the back of cost savings.

We remain optimistic about the macroeconomic environment and feel that the government’s ability to implement its economic agenda (including deficit reduction and privatization) and impose IMF-directed reforms holds the key.
