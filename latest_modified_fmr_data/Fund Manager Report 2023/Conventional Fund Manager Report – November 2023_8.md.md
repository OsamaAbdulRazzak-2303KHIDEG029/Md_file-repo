Fund Managers' Report November 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

Foreign exchange reserves increased to US$12.39bn by November 24, 2023, compared to US$11.99bn at the end of last month. PKR has remained relatively stable at the level of 285.17, as the stern administrative actions taken by the caretaker setup continued to bear fruits. On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Inflation for the month of November clocked at 29.2%. Housing and Food segments remained major contributors and accounted for 92% of overall monthly change. Perishable food prices including tomatoes and eggs continued to increase in response to rising inflation. While increased gas charges contributed to the rise in Housing segment.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till January 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year, however, the recent gas tariff hike is expected to keep the sequential trend in the positive territory. This may add pressures to WPI in the form of potential cost pass on by the affected industries. Nonetheless, despite increasing sequential inflation, the higher base set in preceding months will likely lead to disinflation during 2HFY24.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

During the month of November, Pakistan reached staff level agreement with IMF staff on the first review under the Stand-by Agreement, which will result in release of payment of around $700mn after the approval of IMF’s Executive board.

The caretaker setup has claimed of a substantial investment by Saudi Arabia, China and UAE in Pakistan over the next 2-5 years. This has the potential to be a material positive development for the country if agreements related to the said investments are signed in near future. Moreover, the IMF program will provide a framework for financial support from multilateral agencies and help in tackling the external account problems, which the country is expected to face in the next 3 years because of massive debt repayments.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of November clocked at 29.2%. Gas and Food segments remained the major contributors to the monthly change and accounted for 92% of overall MoM increase. Perishable food prices including tomatoes and onions continued to increase in response to rising inflation. Increased gas prices mainly contributed to increase in the electricity segment.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till January 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the impact of volatility in oil prices due to current Middle East conflict and increase in gas prices may result in higher than expected inflation going forward as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

SBP held three T-Bill auctions during the month of November, with a target of PKR 3,375 billion against the maturity of PKR 4,628 billion. In the first auction, amount of PKR 982.9 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 21.95%, 21.99% and 22.00% for 3-month, 6-month and 12 months’ tenure respectively. In the second auction, an amount of around PKR 1025 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 21.45%, 21.45% and 21.50% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures respectively. In the third T-Bill auction, an amount of around PKR 1,015.3 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 21.45%, 21.45% and 21.43% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures respectively.

In the PIB auction, bids worth around Rs 252 billion were realized for 3-years, 5-years and 10-years at a cut-off yield of 17.39%, 15.95% and 15.10%. However, no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years tenures.

Keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Monetary Policy Committee, as it will continue to remain vigilant and assess its stance to achieve price stability.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The Benchmark index, KSE-100 posted a double digit return for second month in a row as return for the month of November stood at a mammoth 16.59%, while the index closed at a level of 60,531 points. The market continued to remain positive after successfully breaching the psychological barrier of 50,000 in the last month after 6 years. Average daily volume increased by 53% on monthly basis as it clocked at 290.6mn compared to previous month’s level of 189.8mn.

The month of November marked return of foreign investors in the market, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$35mn compared to a net outflow of US$12mn in October. This is the highest monthly FIPI number for the last 6 years. Majority of buying from foreigners was concentrated in Commercial banks, Cement and Power Generation. During the month, Commercial Banks, Power generation and Cement were the top performers, contributing 2,095, 900 and 862 points, respectively.

Announcement of election date by Election Commission of Pakistan and the signing of staff level agreement between Pakistan and IMF, enhanced investors’ confidence in the country and the stock market, clearly depicted by continuous increase in volume of benchmark index on monthly basis. Moreover, rollover of US$3bn deposit from Saudi Development Fund also served as a sweetener for the already bullish market.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till January 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the impact of increase in utility tariffs may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

We believe, realization of massive investments from friendly countries and expectations of commencement of monetary easing from second half of fiscal year 2024 can potentially spark a decent rally in the market. Moreover, valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of 4.9x compared to long term average of 8x.
