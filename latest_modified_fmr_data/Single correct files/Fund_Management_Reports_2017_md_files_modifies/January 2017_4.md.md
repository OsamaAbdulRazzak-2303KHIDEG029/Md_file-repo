## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI inflation in January 2017 remained flat at 3.66% (3.70% in December 2016) on the back of rise in quarterly house rent index (increase of 2% MoM) along with increase in health sector (6.4% MoM). Food inflation declined for the second consecutive month (1.2% MoM) whereas the fuel prices increased twice during the month. Pakistan’s trade deficit during the month of December 2016 stood at USD 2.8bn, up 35% YoY, with exports continuing to remain under pressure (decrease of 3% YoY). Meanwhile, imports witnessed an increase of 18% YoY, driven primarily by an improvement in Food, Autos & Machinery related imports. During the month of January SBP announced Monetary Policy Statement, where it stated that the policy rate for the next 2-months would remain unchanged at 5.75%. Some of the reasons attributable to the decision included increasing risks on the external account with current account deficit expanding by 2.1x to USD 3.6bn in 1HFY17, credit expansion with loans to private sector rising by 12.8% YoY, and lastly, recovering real economic activities with improving energy supplies due to improvement in business sentiments. According to data released by SBP, remittances acknowledged in December amounted to USD 1.58bn, which reflects a decline of 2% on both monthly and annual basis. Additionally, Foreign exchange reserves remained flattish in January to USD 23.2b whereas PKR depreciated by USD 0.3% to PKR 104.75 during the month.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of January bond yields decreased significantly as a result of renewed interest by financial institutions in government securities. The previous T-bills rate were 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month 5.94%, 5.98%, 5.99%, respectively. The results of the latest MTB auction of January, 18 ‘2017 showed a downward trend as the cut offs for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month were slashed to 5.9017%, 5.9258% and 5.9598% respectively. The target for the auction amounted to PKR 450 billion out of which PKR 519 billion was accepted. The State bank of Pakistan (SBP) also conducted a PIB auction where it sold PKR 39.396bn worth of long-term bonds, lower than the pre-auction target of PKR 50bn. The bond yields in the auction rose by 0.2104, 0.1988, and 0.1419 bps in 3-year, 5-year and 1-year bonds respectively.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market remained stagnant during the month of January 2017, rising by 2% MoM to close the KSE-100 index at 48,757 points. It touched the 50,000 points mark during the month, which was unable to sustain due to: profit taking by investors, settlement of individual clients debit positions (in-house financing) to avoid over exposure in the market, along with strong statements from a White House Official hinting to potentially add Pakistan to Trump’s immigration ban list led to decline in last two trading days of the month eroding 2.41% (1,206pts) from the market. The average daily traded volume and value of KSE All index clocked in at 443 mn and 22,682 mn, respectively. Strong local liquidity (mainly mutual funds and individuals) reversed the impacts of strong selling by foreigners and commercial banks. Total foreign outflow for the outgoing month closed at USD 111 million, which brings total selling for 7MFY2017 to USD 409m.

The Top performing sectors for the month were mainly refinery and engineering recording an appreciation of 31% and 24%, respectively. Fertilizer sector also remained under limelight due to Government of Pakistan’s decision to restore fertilizer subsidy, which was earlier withdrawn. Further, the power sector remained upbeat in which the major performer HUBC was up 12% MoM given the company exercised its option to increase its stake in 2x660MW coal plant from 26% to 47.5%. Meanwhile Banking and E&P showed a negative return of 1.3% and 4.5%, dragging index by 158 and 288pts, respectively.
