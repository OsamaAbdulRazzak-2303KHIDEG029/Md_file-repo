Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report December 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing continued to plummet in October as well, taking the relevant index down by 6.48% YoY for 4MFY20. The biggest decline has been witnessed in automobiles, steel products and appliances. CPI clocked in at 12.63% for the month of Dec’19 as compared to 12.67% in the previous month as reversal in prices of perishables such as chicken, onions, tomatoes and fresh vegetables helped food inflation post a decline of 1.4% MoM.

Macroeconomic indicators have continued to improve since the initiation of the IMF program. Foreign exchange reserves increased to 22 months high of USD 18.08 bn as of 27 December 2019. Rupee has been relatively stable, in-fact appreciated slightly by 0.25% against USD during the month of December. Current Account balance has shown tremendous improvement as CAD has reduced drastically by 73% during 5MFY20, owing to sizable reduction in imports of 18% and 4% growth in exports. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation which has helped in curbing luxurious imports along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Further improvement in the current account is expected as exports will start to increase as FTA with China can potentially lead to an increase in exports going forward. Foreign remittances registered an increase of 9% YoY for the month of Nov, 2019.

Discount rate has remained unchanged since last 2 monetary policy meetings signaling a peak of the monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate depending upon any inflationary shocks due to hikes in energy tariffs in particular. Recently, the government has postponed the implementation of CNIC condition for three months in the face of a nationwide strike by traders as business activity depressed significantly due to its application. Any further positive development.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

CY19 began on a hawkish note, and SBP announced a 25bps hike in discount rate in January, citing challenges to economy on multiple fronts, especially fiscal & current account deficit and persistently high core inflation. The market welcomed the rate hike positively and the yield curve shifted downwards owing to interest in longer tenure bonds. Consequently, participation in both fixed and floating coupon bonds auctions received an overwhelming response post DR hike. However during Mar19, the market again started expected another round of interest rate hikes, terming it as one of the pre-conditionality for entering into the IMF program. Hence the yield curve once again took a drastic shift and investors shied away from longer tenors.

During 2Q CY19 market remained volatile owing to the continued monetary tightening and the much awaited currency depreciation (approx. 18% in 1H CY 19). The hawkish measures taken by the central bank to curb the inflationary pressures hiked the key policy rate by 2.25% during 1H CY19. Moreover, it did not end there, as mounting inflationary pressures forced the SBP hike the policy rate by another 100 bps in Jul19. The governor state bank termed that adjustments related to exchange rate and interest rate from previously accumulated imbalances had taken place. The positive statement on stable interest rate revived up the sentiments amongst the institutional investors. This paradigm shift formed an inverted yield curve where most of the interest was now in long term instruments resulting in heavy demand which pushed yield of longer tenor securities further downwards.

The market based exchange rate system encouraged foreign investments in local debt market and since 3Q CY19, there has been a tremendous foreign interest in debt investments in the country by foreigners. Till date Pakistan has received more than USD 1.5 billion in debt investments and this coupled with bilateral / multilateral inflows and proceeds from IMF stabilization program have brought about the much needed stability in PKR against the USD. The country’s foreign exchange reserves have been mounting up to USD 18.1 billion and PKR has been appreciated by more than 5.5% since a record high of PKR 164.05 against USD.

We believe with the consistent policy measures, the economic managers might be able to achieve long term stability in the economy. We foresee the inflationary pressure subside and CPI to fall to single digits during 1H CY 20 and subsequently monetary easing to begin in 2H CY 20. However, any eminent international political and economic shocks pose downside risks, as any upward movement in oil prices may have detrimental impact on the economy.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index increased by 9.9% in CY19 to close the year at 40,735, thus breaking the cycle of two years of negative returns. In USD terms however, the index declined by 1.6%. Moreover, average daily turnover increased by 11.4% to 106mn shares in CY19, reversing the trend of consistent declines since CY15.

Broadly speaking, weak macroeconomic environment kept the market under pressure in 1HCY19. Key reasons behind the pressure include: i) steep increase in policy rate since the start of CY19 (+225bps in 2019), ii) several rounds of devaluation (15% depreciation against USD in 1HCY19), iii) new government’s teething issues as it failed to provide clarity on its plans, iv) delays in finalization of the IMF programme in the wake of tough conditions and v) deteriorating reserves position, leaving an import cover of less than two months (SBP reserves of USD 7.3bn as of June 2019). Nevertheless, improvement in macroeconomic scenario in the second half of the year like: i) stability in the exchange rate (appreciation against USD of 3.3%), ii) decline in current account deficit and iii) increase in SBP’S USD reserves to 11.3bn as of 27 Dec 2019 drove an index rally of +41.6% in since Aug’19. Furthermore, opposition failed to unite and mount a significant challenge to the government which led to a relatively stable political environment.

The year saw a portfolio investment outflow of USD 56mn, which is a massive improvement over last year’s outflow of USD 537mn. Moreover, CY19 marked as the fifth consecutive year of net foreign portfolio investment outflow. Banks, Fertilizer and Cement were the most attractive sectors for the foreigners, attracting an investment of USD 69mn, USD 34mn and USD 28mn respectively. In contrast, oil and gas exploration sector was the main reason behind the decline in foreign investment, contributing USD 75mn to the outflow.

Banking Sector was the top contributor to the Index’s rise as it increased the Index by 1714 points, on account of monetary tightening and foreign interest. Strong dynamics of the fertilizer industry led to the sector contributing 1194 points to the index. Oil and gas exploration sector contributed 912 points to the index amid PKR depreciation and relative stability in oil prices. Several rounds of currency devaluation and volatile commodity prices kept the Cements under pressure in CY19, taking away 153 points from the index. Moreover, tobacco and pharma sector contributed 167 and 80 points to the decline in index.

Going forward, macroeconomic improvement, barring geo-political hiccups, is likely to drive the market moving ahead, where the market trades at a forward multiple of around 7x compared to average P/E of 8x.
