## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI for Nov'15 clocked in at 2.73% YoY, creeping up by 0.58% on account of 3.01% jump in perishable food prices and 0.89% jump in non-perishable food prices. This was the second consecutively higher CPI statistic since September. Notwithstanding lower MoM fuel prices, CPI is expected to take a significant leap next month as low base effect finally factors in.

As per the economic data released for October, current account deficit clocked in at USD 416mn as compared to a surplus of USD 299mn in September. This takes the cumulative FY16-YTD deficit to USD 532mn – 72% lower YoY. The deficit arose from (i) 13% MoM decline in remittances and (ii) a services trade deficit of USD 219m. The negative account balance and anticipated hike in the US Fed rate has led to depreciation of the Pak Rupee by 0.8% over November. Despite pressure on the currency, foreign exchange reserves held steady at USD 19.8bn on monthly basis, with the Finance Minister anticipating reserves to rise to USD 21bn in the near future.

In the face of a stressed Pak Rupee and unrelenting FIPI outflow, the State Bank of Pakistan kept the discount rate unchanged at 6.5% (target rate unchanged at 6.0%) in November for another two months. The policy rate, although still much higher than trending inflation, has been a boon for the leveraged corporate sector as it has enabled levered firms to reduce costs, increase profitability and in some cases even undertake expansion.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The State Bank of Pakistan left the discount rate / target rate unchanged at 6.5% / 6.0% in the monetary policy held on November 21, 2015. The decision can be attributed to (i) end of disinflation and resultant reversal in CPI (ii) an under-pressure Pak Rupee which has depreciated by 4.2% over FY16TD and (iii) anticipated slowdown in exports.

FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. With inflation expected to rise further on the back of low base effect phenomenon from December onwards, the gap between the prevalent policy rate and inflation could narrow down significantly. This coupled with a stressed Pak Rupee signals an end to the monetary easing cycle in Pakistan. Having said that, monetary tightening is unlikely as low global commodity prices could keep inflation at low levels in the immediate future.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After posting a phenomenal return of 6.1% over October, the KSE-100 index slipped by 5.9% (approximately 2,000 points) in Nov'15 owing to foreign selling, regulatory enquiries and ongoing investigation into former office bearers. Apprehensions about Fed rate hike in December FOMC meeting, 10% fall in crude oil prices and rumored agreement between IMF and Pakistan for another gas price hike in Jan’16 also weakened investor sentiments during the month.

Market activity was more concentrated in non-mainstream stocks as value traded slipped by 17%, while volume traded was more or less stable at 171mn shares. Foreigners remained major sellers during the month, offloading shares worth USD 53mn. While foreign selling was primarily observed in Fertilizers, Oil & Gas Exploration sector, Banks and Textiles; buying was recorded in Food Producing sector and Tech companies. On the other end, Non-Banking Finance Companies and Corporations were biggest net buyers in November – purchasing stocks to the tune of USD 20mn and USD 13mn respectively.

While law & order situation and macroeconomic indicators are undoubtedly showing signs of improvement – political, regulatory and external commodity shocks may keep investor sentiments, both foreign and local, in check. In this context, volumes are expected to remain flat, while foreign selling is expected to linger over December. Next month’s US FOMC meeting and OPEC meeting will be crucial events, in addition to brokers-regulator meetings at the local level.
