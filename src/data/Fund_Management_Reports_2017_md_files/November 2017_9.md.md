Fund Managers' Report November 2017

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

According to data released in November, the economy depicted growth during the 1Q FY18, with the Large Scale Manufacturing Index (LSM) up by 8.36% YoY. Biggest contributors to the growth were Automobiles, Iron and Steel, and Food and Beverages Sectors. Going forward, economic growth is expected to remain strong as greater energy availability is expected to give a boost to the textile sector, and consequently to exports. Energy availability has recently received a significant boost as Pakistan’s second LNG terminal was inaugurated during the month of November, which has doubled the country’s capacity for LNG imports to 1.2bcfd. Low borrowing cost and continued public sector expenditure on CPEC and PSDP projects are likely to further propel economic growth. Moreover, electricity tariff is expected to remain stable as the recent fuel shift from furnace oil to coal and LNG is likely to result in lower energy payments, which will more than make up for the greater capacity payments to be made to the new power producers.

The external position received a significant boost towards the end of the month with the successful launch of Sukuk and Eurobonds, worth a combined USD 2.5b, in the international bond market. As the issue was oversubscribed (over USD 8b worth of bids received) and as the yields at which the Sukuk and Eurobond were priced were lower than market’s expectations as well as the Government’s guidance, there is hope that Pakistan will be able to return to the international bond market to ease pressure on the external front in the future. The success of the launch also creates the expectation that Pakistan may not be forced to return to the IMF, and its restrictive covenants, any time soon. Apart from the good news on the Financial Account front, there was some positivity on the Current Account front as well because exports continued to improve on a YoY basis, with exports for 4MFY18 up 11.3% YoY. The Current Account Deficit, however, worsened to USD 5b in the same period, compared to USD 2.3b in the corresponding period last year, due to a surge in imports.

Inflation continued to remain subdued during the month of November, with CPI growth recorded at 3.97% YoY in November compared to 3.8% in October 2017. Upcoming triggers for inflationary pressure include possible PKR devaluation, which will lead to imported inflation, as well as economic growth and greater aggregate demand. On the other hand, stable crude oil prices due to a lack of triggers post OPEC’s oil output pact extension, may keep inflation subdued in the coming months.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of November, market participants remained largely on the sidelines with majority of the activity witnessed only in shorter tenures. In order to address the liquidity crunch, central bank conducted frequent OMO injections, in which participation stood at PKR 1.5trn with the avg. rate of 5.77%. The PIB auction conducted by the SBP on November 15th had to be scrapped due to lackluster interest as the market participants continue to invest in shorter duration government papers. Due to a higher demand for short term government bills, both the T-bills auction saw substantial amount of participation. This resulted in the auction being pro-rated at approximately 65% of the total bids received. Majority of the participation was witnessed in 3Months followed by 6months with little or no participation in 12M tbills. Yields for 3M and 6M were maintained at 5.99% and 6.01% respectively.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After a rout of 6.6% in October, the KSE-100 Index stabilized during the month of November to gain 393 points (1.0% MoM). This performance brought the return of the market in 5M FY18 to a negative 14%. The market was mostly mixed throughout the month as positive sentiments in the Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Sector were countered by jitters in the rest of the energy chain post the Government’s decision to reduce reliance on furnace oil based power producers. Foreign selling ahead of MSCI EM Index’s reconstitution scheduled for November 30th, also added to the negative sentiment. Net foreign portfolio investment outflow was recorded at USD 51.8m in November 2017, the highest monthly outflow since August 2017. Successful launch of new Sukuk and Eurobond of Pakistan, worth USD 2.5b, failed to have any significant positive impact on the equity market.

Oil and Gas E&P stocks buoyed the index during November due to a rise in international crude oil prices ahead of OPEC’s meeting to extend its oil output pact. Arab Light prices were up by 4.4% during the month, which led OGDC (+8.25%) and PPL (+5.2%) emerge as the two top leaders of the index by index points. Given that OPEC’s pact has now been extended till the end of 2018 and that there are few other triggers in sight, crude oil prices are expected to remain stable in the near future, leading to stability in the prices of local E&P stocks. Contrary to E&P stocks, rest of the energy chain suffered due to the Government’s abrupt decision to reduce the amount of electricity lifted from furnace oil based power plants. This decision led PSO (-8.92%) to emerge as one of the worst performers in the Index by index points, as its bottom line is expected to take a hit from lower furnace oil sale. Market prices of HUBC (-3.34%), NPL (-23.31%) and NCPL (-19.71%) too declined as they stand to lose out on fuel and O&M savings as a result of lower capacity utilization. Similarly, refinery stocks remained depressed because the Government’s decision raised inventory levels of FO and disrupted their operations. Gas distribution companies too underperformed the index because of OGRA’s proposal to change their tariff structure, for which public hearings are currently underway. Furthermore, the Banking sector underperformed the index as expectations of a rate hike were pushed further into the future due to the bond issue in the international market.
