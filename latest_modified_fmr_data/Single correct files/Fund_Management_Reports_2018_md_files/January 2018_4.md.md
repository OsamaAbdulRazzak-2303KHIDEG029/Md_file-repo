Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report January 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Strong economic growth has continued so far this year, with the LSM Index up 7.19% in the first five months of FY18. In a disconcerting development, however, consumer confidence declined for a second straight reading in January. According to SBP, consumer confidence declined 3.5% in January, following a 5.9% decline reported in November. Nevertheless, the outlook on economic growth remains bright due to low interest rates (even with the rate hike in January), high public sector expenditure and greater energy availability. Energy availability is set to improve even further with more than 800MW RLNG based power projects expected to come online by March 2018 and a new 800mmcfd LNG terminal scheduled to come online in early 2019. According to a survey conducted by Bloomberg in January, economists now expect GDP growth rate at 5.5% for CY18, up by 40bps from the previous consensus estimate of 5.1%.

The external position continued to worsen in Jan18, as foreign exchange reserves went down to USD 19.4bn from USD 20.2bn as at the end of Dec17. The Rupee, however, managed to stay afloat and close at PKR 110.5150/USD vs. Dec17 close of PKR 110.4500/USD. Moreover, the current account deficit posted in Dec17, of USD 1.1bn, was a slight improvement over the deficit posted in Nov17, of USD 1.4bn. Because exports are likely to continue to increase in the coming months and imports are likely to taper off beyond 2018, the external position is expected to improve in the future. A source of relief in the mid of this year will be the planned issue of another international bond. Furthermore, as per media reports, the Government intends to privatize PIAA before its term ends, which may bring in foreign exchange if sold to investors abroad.

Inflation was recorded at 4.42% in Jan18, compared to 4.57% in Dec17. The CPI reading brought the 7MFY18 inflation average to 3.85%. Given that the Government has raised petroleum product prices in the range of 3.7% to 6.6% for February, and that petroleum product prices have been increased every month since Sep17, inflation is likely to tick upwards. According to a recent Bloomberg survey, economists expect CPI to average 5.8% in 2018, up from 4.09% recorded in 2017.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Since the beginning of CY18, Money Market remained stable and traded in the range of (5.75%-5.90%). Short term yields remained flat in the first half of the January; however long term bond yields continued to move in upward trajectory on the back of soaring oil prices in the international market. During the period, SBP raised approximately PKR 2.5trn in T-bill auction with majority of participation witnessed in 3months, while negligible to no participation was observed in 6 and 12 months. On the other hand, bids PIB auction was again rejected by SBP owing to limited participation from the market participants at higher levels. The month end witnessed a surprise move by the Central bank, as they increasing the discount rate by 25 bps in order to address macro-economic issues. Post MPS Yields in the secondary market witnessed a sharp change as evident from the graph below and the cutoff yields of 3 months in last T-bill auction shifted from 5.99% to 6.21% effectively. Going forward, market participants will eagerly monitor deteriorating macroeconomic indicators which may lead to hawkish stance of MPC members.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index gained 8.8% in Jan18, the highest monthly return since Dec16. Banking and cement sectors outperformed as their valuations had previously reached very attractive levels as they were the worst performers in 2017’s rout. Other top performing sectors included steel and multi-utilities (gas distribution). Meanwhile, electricity and oil and gas sectors underperformed the market. Foreign investors drove the buying pressure during the month, with net FIPI inflow recorded at USD 85.7m. Banks (up 9.89%) contributed the most to the index as investors started expecting higher inflation and as SBP surprisingly increased the target policy rate by 25bps. However, news that the Supreme Court has asked the top banks to draw a scheme providing relief to retirees with retrospective effect created some jitters towards the end of the month. Given the outlook on inflation, and that 2018 will be a year of monetary tightening, banks are expected to remain in the limelight. In the very short term (February), sentiments in the sector will be driven by the earnings season, which is expected to be lackluster as earnings bottom out in CY17.

Cements (up 17.46%) were the second biggest drivers of the index in January as their cheap valuations attracted investors. Furthermore, the Katas Raj case created hope that certain expansion plans will be abandoned in Punjab, thereby reducing the risk of overcapacity and price war in the future. Oil and Gas sector underperformed the market even as crude oil prices rallied internationally to reach the highest levels since December 2014. The major reason for the underperformance was that POL decided to not incorporate higher well-head gas prices as under the 2012 E&P policy for certain fields in the Tal block. This development created fears that other E&P companies too will not account for higher well-head prices for fields that were supposed to be transferred to the 2012 policy. Other remarkable stories that emerged during January include the ban on FFL’s milk brand, stay on collection of anti-dumping duties on wall and floor tiles, approval of drug price hike, change in Fitch’s outlook on Pakistan’s economy to “Negative”, further expansion announcement by ISL, and addition of 28 scrips to the MTS eligible list. Moreover, inclusion of several stocks in the defaulters segment, and subsequent removal of two of them (WTL and DCL), created some jitters towards the end of the month.
