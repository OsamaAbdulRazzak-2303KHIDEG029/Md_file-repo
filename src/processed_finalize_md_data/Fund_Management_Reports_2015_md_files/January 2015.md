Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Economic indicators strengthened further over January, buoyed by low crude oil prices, stable Pak Rupee and manageable inflation. The benchmark Arab light crude oil averaged USD 44.5/bbl over the month – down 27% MoM. The commodity is now down by 59% since the start of the fiscal year (i.e. Jul’14), which has not only helped ease off external account deficit and trade balance, but has also managed to keep inflation at record low levels.

Current account numbers for Dec’14 posted a surplus of USD 76mn as opposed to a deficit of USD 568mn in Nov’14. Exports rose by a handsome 23% MoM, which helped bring down trade deficit by 11% MoM. Although total imports rose over the month, Petroleum imports dipped by 6% MoM owing to lower crude oil prices. Unless the commodity posts a substantial and a sharp rebound, positives emanating from low crude oil prices are expected to persist.

Headline inflation for Jan’15 clocked in at 3.9% YoY, bringing CPI for 7MFY15 down to 5.8% (8.8% in CPLY). Record-low inflation enabled SBP to cut the policy rate by 100bps. Inflation is expected to remain subdued in the vicinity of 4.5% - 5.5% over 2HFY15, which could bring about another 50-100bps cut in the discount rate before June 2015.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

On account of low commodity prices, record-low headline inflation and high real interest rates, the Central Bank opted to slash the discount rate by 100bps on January 24, 2015. Treasury bills and treasury bonds had already priced -in a cut of 50bps in anticipation of easing before the MPS, and did not take long to incorporate the rest following policy announcement.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued with crude oil stable in the range of USD 45-55 per barrel, and real interest rates still relatively higher than historical average FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism of 150-200bps, we see the discount rate inching lower to 7.5% - 8.0%. Therefore, bond yields may fall further from current levels if disinflation persists. This hypothesis draws support from the sizeable participation in PIBs that the SBP continued to receive in the PIB auction held after the MPS. Against maturity of PKR 6bn, the Central Bank observed an overwhelming participation of PKR 295bn. The authority sold bonds worth PKR 83bn with cut-offs at 8.89% (3Y), 9.75% (5Y) and 10% (10Y).

The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. With further easing on the cards, fixed income managers listing towards medium to long tenor bonds are likely to do well. Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement. That said, bonds yields from hereon may just become more sensitive to commodity prices, especially crude oil, as any further monetary relaxation is dependent on stable CPI numbers, which in turn is heavily weighted towards fuel and foods items.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The equity market commenced CY15 on an extremely strong note, posting 7.2% return in January 2015 to push the KSE-100 index past 34,000 points. Net foreign inflows remained marginal in Jan-15, with a mere USD 3mn net inflow. Volumes for the said index soared to 304mn – a monthly rise of 23% – on account of greater investor confidence, monetary easing and better economic position. Pakistan's weight in MSCI FM-100 continues to rise due to sustained outperformance against other frontier markets. The country's weight in the index has risen to 11.33% placing it just shy of second position currently held by the Nigerian index at 11.44%.

Over January, dividend yield plays and leveraged stocks appreciated greatly in value, as investors locked in future income to buffer against yield re-pricing, while leveraged companies looked set to benefit from lower borrowing cost.

ENGRO contributed the most in terms of index points in January, followed by MCB & DAWH. On the flip side, PPL and POL declined the most in terms of Index contribution owing to weak global crude oil prices. We expect this trend to play out further over 2015 as benefits of lower commodity prices and borrowing costs begin to reflect in corporate profits.
