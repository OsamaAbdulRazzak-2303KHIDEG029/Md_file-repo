Fund Managers' Report August 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Final LSM data for FY18 was released during the month of August which shows growth of 5.38%, lower than 6.13% incorporated in its estimate of GDP growth for the year. Consequently, the GDP growth rate for FY18 will have to be revised downwards. Going forward the growth rate is expected to slow down as the twin deficits (fiscal and current account) are likely to force the government to take some tough measures that will affect growth, for example further interest rate hike and increase in gas tariff. Moreover, there are also chances that the new government will not complete CPEC projects at the same pace as the previous government.

Inflation was reported at 5.84% YoY in August. On a MoM basis, CPI grew by only 0.21% compared to 0.94% in July. The slowdown in inflation was attributable to a decline in average prices of petroleum products during the month as well as an absence of revision in house rent index. Going forward, lagged effect of the PKR devaluation in the first six months of the year and upcoming PKR devaluation may lead to inflationary threats. Another threat to inflation comes from gas prices as the government is considering increasing them by up to 46% on average.

Balance of payments continued to deteriorate as data released during the month showed that current account deficit widened to USD 2.2bn during the month of July. The major reason for the increase was a hike in imports. Foreign exchange reserves ended the month of August little changed, at USD 16.7bn compared to USD 16.9bn at July end. The exchange rate also remained stable during the month, closing at PKR 124.2441/USD as opposed to PKR 124.1880/USD as at the end of July. The new finance ministry is likely to decide on whether or not to approach the IMF to bail out Pakistan’s external position by September end. After that the decision to approach the IMF is likely to be put before the parliament, where the final decision will be made. There is a likelihood that PKR might depreciate further before a bailout package is arranged.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, yield curve shifted upwards with majority of the shift witnessed in the longer tenure (as evident from the graph below), the shift is in line with the expectation of a rate hike by the market participants owing to external vulnerabilities including but not limited to twin deficits and constant decline in forex reserves. Activity during the period remained mostly concentrated in under 90 days T-Bill as the market participants shied away from the taking exposure in the longer tenure. Central bank raised PKR 1.3 trillion cumulatively from the three T-Bill auctions conducted during the month with the combined target of PKR 2 trillion. Participation in the PIB remained muted, however yet again overwhelming response was witnessed in the floating rate bond which closed at 70 bps spread against the 50bps spread of floater-2 which was auctioned in June 2018.

Going forward, deteriorated current account with hefty repayments and insufficient external flows could lead the central bank and the government towards further.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market lost all of July’s gains in August, as the KSE-100 Index retreated by -2.3%. Heightened regulatory risks as the new government took charge and poor corporate earnings announcements were some of the biggest reasons behind the market’s decline. The KSE-100 Index closed at 42,712 with average daily volume of 97m shares, which is 5.9% below the average in July. Foreign investors were net sellers worth USD 67mn in August, which is almost the same as that in July (USD 64m); however, some of their sell-off shifted from Banking Sector to Cement Sector.

Index heavyweight banks, HBL and UBL, were a major contributor to the index decline as their earnings announcements negatively surprised investors. HBL booked a significant amount as expenses for closing operations in New York and transforming its business and compliance processes. Similarly, UBL surprised market players by booking a further PKR 2.0bn as pension expense under its pension case.

Other top contributors to the Index’s declines included Fertilizer stocks, as ECC considered making Fertilizer companies pay PKR 10bn. The ECC alleged that fertilizer companies owed the government this amount because they exported Urea that was manufactured from subsidized gas. Jitters in the sector were also attributable to fears that the government will increase gas tariffs by 30% for the industrials.

The market is likely to remain range-bound in September as market participants wait for the government to make important decisions on the macro-economic front. The key decisions include (i) to go for an IMF bailout package or not, (ii) gas tariff hike, and (iii) measures to resolve the long standing circular debt issue, (iv) regulatory issues, like the charge on fertilizer companies for exporting urea and possible scrapping of deemed duty on petroleum products, will also determine the direction of the market in September.
