Fund Managers' Report April 2017

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of April-2017 recorded a growth of 4.78% YoY (1.4% MoM) compared to 4.9% YoY (0.84% MoM) in March-2017. The number was significantly higher compared to industry expectations of around 4%. The major factors contributing to the uptick were revision in Education (+12.5% YoY) and Housing Index (+5.10% YoY). This should carry 10MFY17 inflation to 4.09% vs. 2.79% in 10MFY16.

The central bank continued its obliging monetary policy maintaining its policy rate at 5.75% in the March-2017 MPS. Demand for credit from the private sector remained healthy as borrowing for fixed investments increased by PKR 159bn vs PKR 102bn 8MFY16, in addition consumer financing; especially auto loans improved significantly in 8MFY17. Energy shortages continued to impede growth, however the speedy work on LNG supply pipelines and power projects is more than encouraging.

The PKR/USD remained relatively stable during the month, and broadly throughout the fiscal year, which is one of the reasons why our total exports for the 8MFY17 were depressed. Trade deficit for the 8MFY17 stood around USD 2.45bn up 39.56% YoY over the same period last year, as imports over 8MFY17 increased by 19.32% to USD 4.0bn amid a 2.54% decline in total exports. Current account deficit for 8MFY17 stood around USD 5.4bn (2.6% of GDP) against USD 2.4bn (1.3% of GDP) for 8MFY16. Moreover, spending on infrastructure and CPEC related projects increased, putting fiscal position into pressure.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, SBP conducted two T-Bill auctions with a cumulative target of PKR 550bn against the maturity of PKR 527bn. Major participation during both the T-bill auctions was witnessed in 3M T-bill. During the first T-bill auction the government was able to fetch the required amount in 3M T-bill while rejecting both the 6M and 12M T-bills and maintained the cutoff yield for the 3M T-bill at 5.9910%. In the second T-Bill auction market participants participated with the substantial amount at the previous cutoff thus government was able to borrow higher than the target amount of PKR 300bn. The federal government raised PKR 360bn with PKR 269bn in 3M at 5.9910%, PKR 84bn in 6M at 6.0109% and PKR 5bn in 12M at 6.0273%.

In the PIB auction held on 19th April 2017, market participants participated at much higher yield than the previous auction, resultantly the entire auction was scrapped by the central bank which shows no intention of government to borrow at higher yields. Maintaining previous cutoffs and scrapping the entire PIB auction cemented the SBP’s stance of borrowing at lower yields with no major shift in monetary policy in the short run.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

During April-2017, KSE-100 yielded a relief rally (+2.4% M/M or 1,145 points) thanks to Supreme Court’s decision to postpone the judgment by way of formulation of a JIT (Joint Investigation Team) for further probe into the Panama Case. The market took the decision positively since majority of the cases referred to JITs have remained unresolved in the past. Pakistan equities beat regional markets during April-2017 by posting a return of 2.4% against the average return of 1.5%. However, this was the lowest return marked by PSX in the past 4-years during April. During the month Mutual Funds appeared as the largest net buyers, increasing their holdings by USD 107.9mn, absorbing almost the entire net selling by Foreigners, Individuals, and Banks/DFIs.

Sector wise, Fertilizer and Non-life insurance were worst performing (trailing KSE100 by 6.1 and 5.2% respectively), while Automobile & Auto-parts and Multi-utilities were top performing (beating KSE100 by 19.5 and 9.4% respectively). With INDU announcing better than expected financial result and HCAR and PSMC introducing new variants. Banking sector added 307 points or 27% to the index’s performance during the month amid strengthening expectations of bottoming out of interest rates and approaching formal inclusion into MSCI EM index.

Key events that will set the tone of the market in the short to medium term are upcoming federal budget, foreign flows post MSCI upgrade, coupled with progress on Dawn leaks case and joint investigation team’s (JIT) probe of evidence/money trail provided by PM.
