Fund Managers' Report August 2016

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy is set to grow by 5.7% in FY17; the increased energy availability along with CPEC and other development projects are expected to thrust the economy forward. Threats to growth are likely to stem from the stability in the foreign exchange market that can negatively impact export competitiveness.

Inflation remained subdued in August due to food prices, with CPI posting a growth of only 3.56% compared to 4.1% in July 2016. Going forward (i) continuation of the recent slippage in crude oil prices due to ebbing of excitement related to the upcoming OPEC meeting, (ii) sluggish global demand, (iii) possible impact of Brexit on global commodity prices, and (iv) excess domestic food stock can keep inflation subdued.

Like the rest of CY16, exchange rate remained stable in August 2016. During FY16, low exports and slowing growth of remittances undermined the benefit from low international crude oil prices. Going forward, threats to the external position stem from (i) slowing down of official transfers, especially after conclusion of the IMF program in September, 2016, (ii) slowing growth rate of remittances, and (iii) dip in export proceeds.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Following a spike in inflation in July, which stood unexpectedly high at 4.1%, yields increased for all tenors by up to 15-25 bps. Despite subdued inflation in August which clocked in at 3.56%, the Central Bank is not expected to change its policy rate in September due to potential upward pressures on consumer prices through (i) increased economic activity, (ii) possible rise in gas tariff, (iii) fiscal slippages, and (iv) possible supply disruptions (v) possible hike in international oil prices during FY17. Going forward, interest rates are expected to remain stable.

During the period SBP conducted 3 T-Bill and 1 PIB auctions, SBP maintained the yield across all the tenors 3M at 5.8571%, 6M at 5.9046% and 12M at 5.9148%. The participation during the entire T-bill auctions remained mostly skewed towards 6 month tenor. On cumulative basis SBP accepted an amount of PKR 930bn against the bids of PKR 1,699bn. The auction target for the month was PKR 850bn while the maturing amount was 783bn.

On 24th August the SBP conducted PIB auction and accepted an amount of PKR 202bn against the bids of PKR319bn, the auction target was PKR100bn while the maturing amount was PKR281bn. The bidding participation was recorded in 3Y (48%), 5Y (30%), 10Y (23%). The yield for 3, 5 and 10 year stood at 6.20%, 6.70% and 7.80% respectively.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After six straight months of a bull-run the market remained almost flat in August 2016. The index broke the psychological level of 40,000 twice during the month but was unable to sustain it both times. The bullish sentiment witnessed since February ended in August due to (i) overdue correction, (ii) certain poor results postings, and (iii) negative net foreign investment in the market for the first time after three consecutive months of net inflow.

Top performers during the month included UBL and NBP, both of whom posted above expected results for the quarter ending in June. Oil and Gas E&P stocks also performed well during the month due to surge in crude oil prices on the back of the upcoming OPEC meeting in September. Moreover, Automobile Assemblers performed well due to their new models, and Engineering sector performed well. On the other hand, stocks that contributed the most to drag the index down included blue-chips like ENGRO, LUCK, HUBC, MCB, and DGKC. Cement sector performed poorly during the month.

The index is expected to face resistance near the 40,000 psychological level and to consolidate if the level is broken. Our outlook for the long-term, however, remains upbeat due to Pakistan’s upcoming reclassification as an emerging market and better corporate earnings in the wake of (i) expected growth spurt driven by investments and activities related to CPEC and PSDP, (ii) enhanced energy availability, and (iii) tax concessions to Shariah compliant companies as well as companies undergoing expansion and BMR activities.
