Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

SBP slashed the key policy rate and the target rate by 50bps in the September monetary policy to 6.5% and 6.0%, respectively. This is the lowest level in decades and the recent cut brings the total easing quantum to 350bps in the last 12 months. There was sufficient room for a cut at this stage; especially when credit off-take remains stagnant with revival necessary to achieve the growth envisaged by the government in the budget.

Current account deficit (released for August) clocked in at USD 219mn as opposed to deficit of USD 175mn in July. Absence of CSF receipts pushed the services balance in red, neutralizing the impact of lower trade deficit (23% improvement MoM). Remittances also shrank by 8% MoM. With monthly current account deficit likely to remain at similarly restrained level in the near term, forex reserves are likely to increase owing to issuance of USD 0.5bn Euro bonds and receipt of IMF's quarterly tranche.

Headline inflation for the month clocked in at 1.32% YoY, which was below consensus estimate. The reading was much lower than the preceding reading of 1.70%, with the highlighted disinflation attributable to dip in fuel and food prices, and high base effect. Although gas prices did witness a hefty uptick of 10%, subdued reading in other key heads resulted in MoM dip of 0.1% in CPI. Core inflation (excluding food and energy), on the other hand, remained largely flat on monthly basis to post yearly figure of 3.4% YoY. Inflation seems to have bottomed out at this point and will likely observe a reversal from October.

Although real interest rates remain high even after the recent rate cut, anticipated reversal in inflationary numbers going forward may keep interest rates stable for now, with a nominal rise anticipated later in the fiscal year.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march.

With 50bps reduction in the key policy rate in September, T-bills and PIBs trended lower over the latter half of the month. Although IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs. Although the interest rate cycle is expected to remain comfortable over the ongoing fiscal year, longer tenor instruments may see some profit taking and yield reversal as investors shift exposure from longer-tenor bonds to short or medium tenor bonds.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market continued its descent in September, slipping by a hefty 7% on the back of foreign outflow and weak investor sentiments. This was consistently seen across all global emerging markets in anticipation of an imminent Sep'15 interest rate hike by the US Federal Reserve. Locally, foreigners were net sellers for the third consecutive month, with USD 22mn flowing out. Selling was concentrated mainly in Banks, E&P companies and Fertilizer stocks. The net FIPI outflow has now swelled to USD 176mn over 9MCY15.

HBL, OGDC & FFC contributed the most to the bearish trend during the month, while HUBC saw the biggest positive contribution among the KSE-100 index companies. Sector wise return shows Oil & Gas, Banks & Telecom underperforming the most amongst the key sectors.

Volumes and value traded (KSE-100 index) dropped by 39%, predominantly due to poor sentiments. Towards the end of the month, SECP clarification concerning ongoing broker investigation helped restrain investor apprehensions, and improved market sentiments to a certain extent. That said, foreign flows and traded volumes will remain critical going forward in determining the market’s direction.
