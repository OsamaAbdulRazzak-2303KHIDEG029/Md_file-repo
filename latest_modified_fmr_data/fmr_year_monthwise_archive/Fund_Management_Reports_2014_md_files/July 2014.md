Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Inside this issue: Considering the rise in political commotion, we expect the market to remain under pressure till a political settlement is reached between all the stakeholders. If the incumbent government is able to tactfully handle opposition demands, the market will likely stabilize and enter consolidation to set grounds for result season rally. Failure to do so may lead to value erosion on account of political uncertainty. With the result season in the offing, fundamentally sound companies will likely continue to perform well on the bourse on the back of foreign flows.

On the fiscal front, June’s current account deficit clocked in at USD89mn versus USD57mn for May. This took the cumulative FY14 current account deficit to USD2.9bn as opposed to USD2.5bn witnessed in the corresponding period of last year, mainly due to lower CSF receipts. With current account position worsening in FY14, some respite in Balance of Payment has come from improvement in both capital and financial account. Capital account surplus during FY14 stood at USD1.83bn. Financial account, meanwhile recorded a surplus of USD5.2bn on account of higher bilateral financing and launch of Euro bonds.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Primary and secondary money market yields remained stable throughout July as liquidity variation remained low and the discount rate remained unchanged. In the Monetary Policy Statement released during the month, the Central Bank decided to keep the key rate unchanged at 10% in order to maintain currency stability and sustain real interest rates.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued International Monetary Fund (IMF) under the Extended Fund Facility. With IMF pressure expected to escalate in the next tranche disbursement meeting, the Central Bank may keep the rates unchanged. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE 100 managed a strong 2.2% rally during the month, albeit with lower volumes owing to the normal slowdown in activity witnessed during the holy month of Ramadan. The benchmark KSE 100 broke through the 30,000 point barrier on the back of continued foreign inflows, and closed at 30,314 points. Top three key outperforming sectors were Automobiles, Telecom & Electricity, while Food producers and Personal Goods were the biggest underperformers.

CPI numbers for July clocked in at 7.9% YoY, with MoM CPI showing a hike of 1.7%. Food inflation (especially perishable items) remained the key driver owing to the Ramadan effect. The House Rent Index also saw its quarterly revision in the outgoing month, which ended up propping monthly inflation further. Core inflation saw a MoM rise of 1.1% mainly due to House rent revision, but dipped on a YoY basis to 8.3% in July. In the coming months, CPI is expected to continue to recede mainly due to high base effect. The Headline inflation could drop to as a low as 6% in November. The decline will likely be complemented by sliding international oil prices and the government’s decision to defer gas and power tariff hike. With the widening corridor between inflation and discount rate amidst improving economic numbers, a nominal cut of 50bps could be seen in next month’s monetary policy meeting.

## Fund Activity

During the month, Alfalah GHP AIF generated MTD return of 1.33%. The reduction in fund size has led to a significant re-shuffling of the investment portfolio due to which the non earning asset holds a significant portion of the fund. Also the returns have been volatile because of price movement on shares that the fund holds.

## Fund Activity

Alfalah GHP IIF generated a return of -1.31% for July 2014. The underperformance resulted from adverse impact on GoP Ijara SUKUK holding. It was decided to offload the same as it caused excess volatility. During the month the fund targeted and increased its exposure to high yielding corporate SUKUKs and increased allocation to cash & equivalents as it yielded better returns than the GoP Ijara holding.

## Fund Activity

AGVF generated a return of 1.33% over July 2014, as opposed to benchmark return of 1.51% for the same period. The fund outpaced the benchmark initially on the back of exposure in Automobile sector and Construction & Cement sector, which reverted in the aftermath of the Bestway-Lafarge acquisition deal. Going forward, exposure to Construction & Cements will be reduced, and reallocated to sectors with better prospects and higher upside potential (e.g. Commercial Banks, Personal Goods, Chemicals etc).

During the month, the fund also took exposure in PIBs to enhance fund returns. Going forward, we anticipate bonds to yield capital gains on the back of stable (possibly expansionary) monetary outlook.

## Fund Activity

AGSOF generated a return of 11.85% in July. During the month, the fund faced revaluation gains on its bond portfolio which resulted in attaining commendable performance for the month.

With our view of a stable interest rate, the fund’s investment strategy is focused towards medium term government bonds which offer a higher yield in addition to the potential for gains if interest rates ease off.

Going forward, the focus will be on trading of GoP bonds to generate yield enhancement, while maintaining the current portfolio mix.
