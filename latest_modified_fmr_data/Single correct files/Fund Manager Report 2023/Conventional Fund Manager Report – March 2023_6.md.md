Fund Managers' Report March 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps. As a result, PKR closed at an all-time low of 283.79 against USD at end of the month compared to 261.5 on Feb 28, 2023.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms). With consistent low level of foreign reserves, SBP has placed stringent control on imports due to which current account deficit remained largely controlled at USD3.86bn (down 68%YoY) in 8MFY23 compared to USD12.07bn during the same period last year. In the remaining fiscal year, the external deficit would remain on lower side amid import restrictions and normalization of remittances flows.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

CPI for the month of March clocked at 35.37% with Food and Beverages & tobacco segments being the major contributors to the monthly change, however, the MPC highlighted that there are indications of inflation peaking close to current levels. The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

Subsequent to month end on April 04, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 100 basis points to 21% and barring any unexpected shocks, the real interest rate is in positive territory on a forward-looking basis. The average inflation for FY23 is now expected in the range of 27%-29%.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of March clocked at 35.37%. Food and Beverages & tobacco segments being the major contributors to the monthly change. Non-perishable food prices including cooking oil continued to face the brunt of PKR devaluation while beverages and tobacco segment witnessed increase in prices as manufacturers looked to pass on the impact of increase in FED imposed in the mini-budget. Inflation is expected to be elevated and above 30% at least for the next 3 months due to PKR devaluation and adjustment in utility tariffs before falling sharply from June onwards because of a high base.

In Monetary policy meeting held on April 04, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 100 basis points to 21%, citing expectations of high inflation in near future. However, the MPC highlighted that there are indications of inflation peaking close to current levels and barring any unexpected shocks, the policy rate of 21% has maintained the real interest rate in positive territory on a forward-looking basis.

In the latest T-Bill auction held on March 22, 2023, SBP accepted total bids amounting to PKR 927bn, 16bn and 125bn in 3months, 6months and 12months tenors at cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.99% and 21.949% respectively. The auction had a total maturity of PKR 255bn against a target of PKR 900bn.

In the PIB auction held on March 15, 2023, the Central Bank accepted bids worth PKR 26bn and PKR 350mn in 3years and 5years at cut off rates of 18.05% and 13.80%. The auction had a total target of PKR 100bn.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a negative return of 1.26% during the month of March to close at 40,001 points. The average daily volume decreased by 20.4% on MoM basis as it clocked at 81.24mn compared to previous month’s level of 102.03mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$6.72mn compared to a net inflow of US$8.48mn in February, where the buying was concentrated in E&Ps (US$1.35mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$4.70mn. On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 97 points. On the contrary, Miscellaneous sector contributed negatively to the index the most by 649 points.

The current month once again remained story of two halves as the index rallied to 41,874 points, posting a return of 3.37% in first half of the month as investors remained optimistic on resumption of the stalled IMF program as all the key reforms and conditions were now being implemented. However, delays in staff level agreement due to non-materialization of support from friendly countries and the political turmoil in the country rocked investors’ confidence, resultantly the index couldn’t hold on to the earlier positivity and closed at 40,001 points by month end due to continuous selling pressure.

Inflation for the month of March clocked at 35.37%. Food and Beverages & tobacco segments being the major contributors to the monthly change. In response to rising inflation, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 100 basis points to 21%, however, the MPC highlighted that there are indications of inflation peaking close to current levels and barring any unexpected shocks, the policy rate of 21% has maintained the real interest rate in positive territory on a forward-looking basis.

The government has now implemented all the necessary reforms in order to revive the IMF program including market based exchange rate, mini budget to cover shortfall in tax revenue, reduction in subsidies, increase in utility tariffs and hike in policy rate, we believe that the talks with IMF are in conclusive phase and staff level agreement should be reached once there is solid commitment of bilateral support from friendly countries.

Clarity on political front, successful review of IMF and macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR/USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term. However, valuation remains enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of ~3.5x (2023) compared to long term average of more than 8x.
