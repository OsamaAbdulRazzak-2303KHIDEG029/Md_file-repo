## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan observed substantial economic progress over CY15, with improvement seen across majority of indicators. Much of this improvement was owed to the low commodity cycle, which mainly benefits trade deficit countries like Pakistan that import oil and petroleum products. Owing to low crude oil prices, headline inflation averaged at 2.54% YoY over the year – a multi-decade low level for Pakistan. Price declines were mainly due to the oil import bill, which saw a reduction of 39% YoY. Low oil prices not only lowered import bill (-9%) and improved trade deficit (-20%), but also kept incremental circular debt in check. CPI also saw decline emanating from low food prices on the back of depressed agro-economics.

The country saw its credit rating upgraded in May'15 by Moody’s and S&P’s to B3 and B-, respectively, on the back of ongoing economic reforms, improving macroeconomic indicators and demand expected from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). Outlook on the country was also changed from stable to positive by the agencies. This improvement in rating enabled Pakistan to successfully launch another 10-year Eurobond worth USD 500m in Sep’16 at a rate of 8.25%, after having raised USD 3bn in 2014. The government also successfully raised USD 1.02bn from privatization of Habib Bank Limited (HBL). Improving current account, Eurobond issues and privatization proceeds pushed foreign exchange reserves to historical high of USD 21bn (Dec’16) over the year.

During CY15, the Central Bank revised the key policy rate down by 300bps to 6.5%, and reduced the overnight target rate to 6.0%. The move came in light of record-low inflation and positive real rate of return, and was aimed at lifting private sector credit off-take and providing impetus to economic growth. The step also helped industries and businesses reduce their financing costs and avail cheaper leverage for expansions.

Going forward, Pakistan is likely to continue to observe improvement in macroeconomic indicators, especially current account, foreign exchange reserves and GDP growth. Few areas that still need government attention include fiscal deficit, tax-to-GDP ratio/tax targets and privatization of struggling state-owned entities.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

On account of record low inflation, the State Bank of Pakistan instituted aggressive monetary policy over CY15 by slashing the discount rate by 300bps to 6.5%. With price levels under control, the regulator aimed at boosting aggregate demand and demand for loanable funds.

The year was particularly generous to bond fund managers who maintained high duration PIB exposures. Yields slipped substantially on these longer-tenor instruments, generating higher returns through capital gains. The easing cycle brought down bond yields by 234bps (3Y), 151bps (5Y) and 131bps (10Y) over CY15. The government increased its borrowing horizon considerably and funded the fiscal gap via longer-tenor PIBs as opposed to T-bills. The SBP conducted 12 PIB auctions and targeted PKR 600bn in borrowings, mopping up a sizeable PKR 787bn against this target. In order to better manage overnight liquidity, the Central Bank also introduced a target rate over CY15, which was kept 50bps below the discount rate (introduced in May’15). The target rate did help restrain overnight volatility, as lending and borrowing closely followed the set rate during the latter half of the year.

FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The local equity market posted a return of 2.1% over the outgoing CY15 as the KSE-100 index rose from 32,131 points to 32,816 points. The index outperformed MSCI EM (-16.9%), MSCI FM (-17.3%) and MSCI Pakistan (-18.3%) on the back of performance generated by non-mainstream sectors. Average daily volumes were only marginally up (+5%) from 136mn (CY14) shares to 143mn (CY15) shares owing to caution exercised by investors on the back of certain local and foreign factors.

Despite having multi-decade low discount rate that touched a low of 6.5% in Sep’15, the equity market posted a sluggish performance, especially over the latter half of the year. This can be attributed to the downward trend in the index heavy Oil and Gas sector (-31%) and the Banking sector (-15%). Banking sector, the heaviest weighted sector in the index, took a beating on account of interest spread compression and WHT tax led slowdown in deposit growth. The Oil and Gas sector, on the other hand, remained under pressure due to falling international crude oil prices. US Federal Reserve rate hike anticipation, regional currency devaluation, ensuing global equity slump, foreign selling and economic slowdown in China also restrained the local equity market.

This dynamic prompted a sell off in EM & FM markets to which Pakistan was no exception. Foreigners sold stocks worth USD 315mn over the year, with Mutual Funds, Banks and NBFCs lending support through heavy stock purchases throughout the year.

While lower commodity prices hurt commodity producers, they impacted most manufacturing sectors positively as low raw material prices propped up gross margins and lifted earnings of value additive industrial companies. In this connection, Industrial Metals & Mining (+97.5%), Engineering (+26.1%), Household Goods (+22.6%), Pharmaceuticals (+16.4%), Construction Sector (+13.6%) and Automobile Sector (+13.3%) outperformed the broader index during the period. Notable appreciation was witnessed in the Software and Computer Services sector, which appreciated by an impressive 284% on the back of rapidly developing base of clientele and larger orders.

We remain optimistic about the equity market over CY16 and expect the market to leverage improving economic indicators. This improvement shall emanate from low commodity prices, economic reform agenda and demand from CPEC projects. Pakistan’s re-entry into the emerging market remains an eagerly anticipated trigger for 2016.

## Fund Performance 2015

"I took the road less traveled by, and that has made all the difference" - Robert Frost

## Equity Funds: Dominating in All Categories

Calendar Year 2015 was a challenging year for equities. The stock market’s dismal performance of 2.13% during CY15 reflects the most prominent slowdown in gains since 2011. Various internal and external factors contributed to this as discussed earlier.

Alfalah GHP’s equity based funds, however, adopted a purely research based stock selection strategy and performed phenomenally well compared to their respective peers and benchmark indices. All our equity funds were ranked the highest in their category, which was a result of effective stock selection and allocation, active management, and bottom up research approach. Following is a snapshot of how our funds stacked up against benchmark indices and their CY15 performance ranking among peers.

| Fund                           | Category         | CY15 Return | Benchmark | Peer Group Ranking |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Alfalah GHP Islamic Stock Fund | Islamic Equity   | 23.24%      | 9.60%     | 1st                |
| Alfalah GHP Value Fund         | Asset Allocation | 21.28%      | 4.75%     | 1st                |
| Alfalah GHP Stock Fund         | Equity           | 18.22%      | 2.13%     | 2nd                |
| Alfalah GHP Alpha Fund         | Equity           | 16.33%      | 2.13%     | 3rd                |

Alfalah GHP Islamic Equity Fund posted a return of 23.24% against its benchmark (KMI-30 Index) performance of 9.60% - an outperformance of 13.64%. The fund also outpaced its nearest competitor by a dominating 8.48%. During the year, the fund generated investment alpha from Construction & Materials, Automobile & Parts, Electricity sector, Chemicals, Pharmaceutical sector, and selected stocks within the Oil & Gas sector.

Alfalah GHP Value Fund yielded 21.28% over CY15, outperforming its benchmark (50% KSE-100 + 50% 6M KIBOR) return of 4.75% by a robust 16.53%. It maintained a well balanced mix of equities and fixed income products to hedge against volatility in equity market, while being able to post a healthy return. Investments were mainly concentrated in Construction & Materials, Automobile & Parts, Electricity sector, Chemicals, Pharma & Biotech sector, Oil & Gas sector, Government T-bills & PIBs.

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back of unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.
