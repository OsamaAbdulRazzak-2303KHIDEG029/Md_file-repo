Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report December 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan's economic performance in 2024 marked a significant improvement compared to the previous year. The country successfully concluded its Standby Agreement with the IMF and secured an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) worth USD 7 billion, which provided much-needed stability and reinforced investor confidence. Alongside this, key macroeconomic indicators such as the current account, fiscal position, exchange rate, and inflation all showed positive trends. Additionally, the onset of a monetary easing cycle added an extra boost, enhancing the overall economic outlook and strengthening the foundation for future growth.

Pakistan’s cumulative current account surplus for the first five months of Fiscal Year 2025 stands at USD 944 million, driven largely by a strong increase in remittances, which grew by 33.6% year-on-year (YoY) during this period. Exports in November 2024 saw a 3.04% YoY increase, reaching USD 2.8 billion, while imports declined by 8.72% to USD 4.13 billion. This resulted in a 25.95% reduction in the trade deficit, which narrowed to USD 1.36 billion.

On the foreign exchange front, Pakistan’s foreign reserves have continued to grow steadily since the IMF program began, reaching USD 11.71 billion, the highest level since April 2022.

In terms of inflation, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for December 2024 stood at 4.1%, down from 4.9% in November, primarily due to base effects. This represents the lowest inflation rate in the past 79 months. The real interest rate remains significantly positive at 8.9%, which provides room for further interest rate reductions in the year ahead.

Despite these positive developments, Pakistan still faces several challenges, including meeting fiscal targets, implementing structural reforms, and addressing the persistent trade deficit. Additionally, political instability, regional conflicts, and a fragile law and order situation pose risks, particularly in the context of fluctuating global commodity prices. Moving forward, it is crucial for Pakistan to focus on executing effective policies to ensure long-term economic stability and sustainable growth.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In December 2024, short-term secondary market yields remained stable, while longer-tenure yields increased by 48 basis points (bps). This rise was mainly driven by market anticipation of a rate cut of over 250 bps in the SBP’s December monetary policy. While yields initially dropped due to improved market liquidity, they partially reversed when the actual rate cut came in at 200 bps, slightly under market expectations.

On December 24, 2024, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) conducted a Treasury Bill auction with a total maturity of PKR 1,565 billion, exceeding the target of PKR 1,350 billion. The SBP accepted bids of PKR 390 billion for 3-month, PKR 213 billion for 6-month, and PKR 255 billion for 12-month tenors at cut-off yields of 12.00%, 11.99%, and 12.30%, respectively. Additionally, on December 18, 2024, the SBP held an auction for fixed-coupon Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs), attracting PKR 59 billion for 2-year, PKR 41 billion for 3-year, PKR 185 billion for 5-year, and PKR 97 billion for 10-year tenors, with cut-off rates of 12.50%, 12.50%, 12.59%, and 12.80%, respectively.

Looking ahead, we expect inflation to decline further in the coming months, aided by currency stability and favorable base effects, with inflation projected to fall to low single digits. The SBP has already reduced interest rates by a cumulative 900 bps since June 2024, bringing the policy rate down to 13.0% from a peak of 22.0%. Following a potential further 100 bps cut, we anticipate the SBP may pause its easing cycle to evaluate the impact of lower rates on the economy. In our base case, we expect the interest rate to stabilize around 12.0%, with the possibility of further cuts if economic conditions improve more than expected.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index delivered another strong performance in December 2024, rising by 13,770 points (13.59%) to reach a record high of 116,169 points before closing the year at 115,126 points. This impressive rally resulted in an 84.3% calendar-year return, making Pakistan the second-best performing market globally for 2024.

The primary drivers of this growth were the Exploration & Production (E&Ps), Fertilizer, and Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), contributing 3,702, 2,213, and 1,380 points, respectively. E&Ps and OMCs benefited from improved cash flows due to higher gas prices, while the Fertilizer sector attracted interest for its strong dividend yields amid declining secondary market rates.

Key catalysts included the announcement of a 79-month low inflation rate, sparking expectations of further rate cuts by the SBP, as well as a $3 billion deposit rollover by Saudi Arabia, which boosted investor confidence. Despite a brief 10,000-point correction due to profit-taking, the market recovered quickly, supported by liquidity inflows, especially from mutual funds. Investors seized this dip as a buying opportunity, with equities becoming more attractive following a 900bps rate cut over the past seven months.

Market activity surged in December, with average traded volume up 44% month-on-month (MoM) to 1,260 million shares, and traded value increasing 62% MoM to $192 million. Foreign investors remained net sellers, with a net outflow of $32 million, while local institutional investors, including Mutual Funds and Banks, contributed net inflows of $56 million and $17 million, respectively.

Looking ahead, investors will focus on political and macroeconomic factors, particularly the IMF’s Extended Fund Facility (EFF) conditions. Key upcoming developments, such as the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decisions, Current Account Deficit (CAD) figures, and fiscal results, will influence market sentiment. Despite recent strong performance, we maintain a positive outlook as the KSE-100 continues to trade at a discount to historical levels, with a forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 6.05x versus a 10-year average of 7.3x, offering attractive opportunities for medium- to long-term investors.
