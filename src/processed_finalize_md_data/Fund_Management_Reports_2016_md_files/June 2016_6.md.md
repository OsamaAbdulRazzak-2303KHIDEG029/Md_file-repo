## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy grew by 4.71% in FY16, the highest rate in the past eight years. This growth was mainly driven by industrial sector, including automobiles, fertilizers, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, rubber, and cement. Growth in the industrial and services sectors was able to compensate for agricultural sector’s poor performance. Going forward, it is expected that output gap (the amount by which the actual output of an economy falls short of its potential output) will be under threat of widening as a result of stability in the FX market, which has been having an impact on export competitiveness. On the other hand, positive factors such as greater energy availability, CPEC projects and other development projects are expected to thrust the economy forward.

Inflation averaged 2.85% during FY16, as opposed to 4.56% in FY16, thanks to impact of low fuel costs on food and beverages and other products’ prices. Going forward, slight uptrend in prices of energy based commodities combined with a low base effect are likely to result in slightly higher inflation by the end of this year and start of the next. Despite that the average inflation for FY17 is likely to fall within the range of 3.75% - 4.00% provided there are no upside shocks to international oil prices. The ministry of finance therefore seems to be in a good position to maintain a stable interest outlook during FY17 which will allow the MoF some room to mitigate any adverse movement in the exchange rate.

The economy’s external position remained stable throughout the second half of this fiscal year, with the result that the exchange rate moved by only -0.02%. Low exports and slowing growth of remittances undermined the benefit from a dip in international crude oil. Going forward, threats to the external position emanate from (i) slowing down of official transfers, especially after conclusion of the IMF program in September, 2016, (ii) slowing growth rate of remittances, (iii) rise in oil prices, and (iv) dip in export proceeds.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Subdued inflation and the resultant reduction of the policy rate twice during FY16, first by 50bps in September 2015 and then by 25bps in May 2016, helped yields come off in the range of 100-250bps during the year. Greatest dip in yields was witnessed for 4 to 10 year instruments, and the market’s focus remained on medium to long term bonds in order to benefit from the easing cycle. The SBP’s borrowing requirements also remained relatively subdues compared to what it had been in the last couple of years so the focus of investment managers and banks remained on booking higher yields in order to support their fixed income portfolio.

Given an outlook of subdued inflation in the short term and slightly higher CPI growth towards the end of 2016 and start of 2017, it is expected that the monetary policy rate will remain stable with a medium to low probability of rising by the mid of FY17. There are slim chances of a further rate cut in the short term, although international oil prices have slid further recently but the expected pressure on Pak Rupee against US Dollar given recent developments on international front e.g. Britain’s exit from Euro zone is likely to force the decision makers to keep the Discount rate unchanged. Factors that can lead to a sooner than expected rate hike include (i) strengthening of oil prices as the world may likely approach narrowing in demand and supply gap, (ii) greater than expected rise in prices of other energy related commodities, and (iii) pressure on PKR due to both a worsening of Pakistan’s external position and strengthening of USD against major currencies as the US Federal Reserve goes ahead with its rate hike plan.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index rose by more than 1,700 points (4.8%) in June to bring the return for FY16 to 9.8%. The market trended downward through the first seven months of the year before turning around towards the end of February. Slipping of international crude oil prices to 12-year lows, weakness in global equities, continuous build-up of selling pressure by foreign investors, and broker investigations were some of the chief drivers of negative sentiments during the first seven to eight months of the year. The market finally turned around in February upon a recovery in crude oil prices. Anticipation of Pakistan’s reclassification by MSCI as an Emerging Market (EM) further fueled local equities. The spirit was hurt towards the end of the year by the surprising vote by the British public to exit the European Union (Brexit).

Worsening of world economic outlook during the year brought crude oil prices crashing down to a 12-year low in January 2016, resulting in a tumbling of international as well as local equity markets. The outlook on crude oil prices was made even murkier by expectations that Iran would add a substantial amount of oil output to the present supply glut, with some reports estimating as high an addition as a million barrels of oil per day. However, oil prices staged a recovery as US’s oil inventory continued to dip and major oil agencies, OPEC and IEA, started foreseeing easing of supply glut.

The rally in the last quarter of the year was mostly attributable to anticipation of Pakistan’s reclassification as an emerging market by MSCI. With the exception of Feroze 1888 Mills, the top 15 drivers of the index were all stocks that were expected to be included in MSCI’s Emerging Market Index (Large, Mid and Small-Cap). The top stocks during the last quarter by index points were Habib Bank, Oil and Gas Development Company, The Hub Power Company, Lucky Cement and United Bank.

Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report June 2016

The market is expected to perform even better in FY17 than in FY16 due to (i) Pakistan's equities' reclassification into MSCI's emerging market index, and (ii) announcement of Federal Budget for FY18 that is expected to be friendly towards the business and agricultural sectors as the Government gears up for the final year of its term.

Equity Funds' Performance

The KSE-100 index mostly trended downwards in the first half of the year before turning around by the end of February to close the year with gains of over 3,300 points (9.8%). As mentioned previously, international crude oil prices were one of the biggest reasons for the decline as well as the later rise of the market. Anticipation of Pakistan’s reclassification as an emerging market by MSCI also drove the market in the last quarter.

Alfalah GHP’s equity funds outperformed their respective benchmarks in FY17 to emerge among the top performers within their respective categories. Outperformance was ensured during the year through superior stock selection and sector allocation.

Alfalah GHP Stock Fund emerged as the top performer among all conventional equity funds by providing a return of 14.88% in FY16 as opposed to its benchmark return of 9.84%. The outperformance was achieved by heavy-weighting the Fund towards Cement stocks in the beginning of the year and then switching to Oil and Gas stocks in a timely manner once international crude oil prices started rallying, while Banks were under-weighted throughout the year. Returns were also enhanced by superior within sector allocation effect. Moreover, holding of star performers in other sectors, like pharmaceuticals and refineries also added to the superior performance of the Fund.

Alfalah GHP Value Fund was the top performing conventional asset allocation fund by giving a return of 18.30% as opposed to its benchmark return of 8.19%. Superior performance was achieved through tilting the fund towards equities and keeping the allocation to bonds at a minimum, as equities far outperformed fixed income during the year. Within equities, alpha was generated by superior sector and stock selection, as mentioned above.

Alfalah GHP Islamic Stock Fund also outperformed its benchmark and beat its competition by providing a return of 20.33% in FY16. Effective stock selection and screening along with identification of timely entry and exit points helped the Fund outperform during the year.
