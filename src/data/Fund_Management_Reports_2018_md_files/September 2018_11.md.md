Fund Managers' Report September 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) Index grew by 0.50% YoY and 6.99% MoM in July 2018. However it is likely that the Index for August might show some decline on the back of slowdown in both automobile and cement sector sales. The Central Bank highlighted in September’s monetary policy statement that LSM growth will suffer from the recent monetary and fiscal measures. Moreover, SBP also mentioned that it expects Agriculture and Ancillary Services Sectors to miss their FY19 growth targets resulting in a slowdown in GDP growth to 5% in FY19 compared to 5.8% in FY18.

Inflation was subdued during the month of September partly due to a decline in petroleum product prices. CPI grew by only 5.12% YoY in September compared to 5.84% in August. There are a number of inflationary pressures on the horizon that could push the CPI reading to above 7.0% in the next six months. These include a surge in international crude oil prices ahead of Iranian sanctions’ deadline and the possibility of a gas tariff hike. The Economic Coordination Committee is also considering raising electricity tariffs, which may further push up consumer prices in the country.

Pakistan’s external position continued to worsen in September, with the country’s total foreign exchange reserves down to USD15.5bn from USD 16.4bn at the end of August. The Current Account Deficit, however, dipped to just USD 600m in August compared to USD 2.1bn in July. The improvement was mostly attributable to a decline in imports, especially machinery imports. Towards the end of the month, both IMF’s staff and a Saudi Delegation visited the country with the intention to help with Pakistan’s depleting foreign exchange reserves position, but no positive news has yet come out of these visits. Keeping in view the inflationary threats and persistent external problems, SBP raised its policy rate by 100bps at the end of September. Another rate hike cannot be ruled out for the remainder of FY19 in case the 275bps hike so far in CY18 is unable to address the macroeconomic issues of the country.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, yield curve shifted upwards depicting signals of deteriorating economic indicators. The shift in the yield curve was in line with market expectations owing to the hawkish view of monetary policy committee. Activity during the period remained mostly concentrated in shorter tenure T-bills as participants shied away from taking exposure in longer tenure.

Muted participation was witnessed throughout the auctions conducted during the month as the central bank was able to raise only PKR 41.2 billion in T-bills auction compared to PKR 1 trillion in August’18, participation in PIB auction was also restricted to 5-Year tenor, to the tune of PKR 4.7 billion compared to PKR 15 billion in August’18.

The recent policy measures undertaken by the incumbent government are steps in the right direction. However, these measures are not sufficient, as concerns on the economic front continue to persist on the back of rising inflation and mounting twin deficits that are likely to compromise the sustainability of real economic growth. The government needs to take decisive policy action and significant external financing to push economy in the right direction.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market continued to decline in September and the KSE-100 Index declined by 1.8% to close at 40,999. Concerns over macro indicators such as forex reserves and current account deficit, approval of the gas price hike, mini-budget and fears of an electricity tariff increase were some of the factors that created selling pressure in the market. Moreover, the unwillingness of the new government to swiftly move to the IMF and no progress on financing from Saudi Arabia also contributed to the negative sentiment.

Meanwhile, crude oil price increase and policy rate hike supported the index as they benefited the Index heavy-weight sectors, Banks and Oil and Gas E&P. KSE-100 Index’s average daily volume declined to only 77m shares in September from 97m shares in August as some market participants chose to remain on the sidelines as they waited for the government to make key economic decisions. Foreigners remained net sellers and sold USD 58m worth of equities during September, with selling concentrated in the Banking and Cement Sectors.

Cement Sector was one of the top contributors to the Index’s declines mostly because the government announced a cut in planned PSDP spending for FY19 in its mini budget. Automobile Assemblers declined as Government’s announcement to withdraw restriction on car purchase for non-filers was rejected by the Senate. Engineering (steel) sector was also one of the top contributors to the index’s declines because of the prospects of an electricity tariff hike.

On the other hand, the market received support from Oil and Gas E&P companies because international crude oil prices rose to their four year high levels ahead of sanctions on Iran taking effect. Commercial Banks also rallied ahead of SBP’s decision to hike policy rate by 100bps. Going forward measures to ameliorate the current account deficit (for example loans from IMF or friendly countries) and fiscal deficit (for example gas and electricity tariff hike) will determine the future course of the market.
