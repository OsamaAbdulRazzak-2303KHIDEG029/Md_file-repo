Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report September 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

In the past month, positive sentiment has followed the IMF's approval of a $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on September 25, which includes an immediate disbursement of $1 billion. This 37-month program aims to support Pakistan’s reform agenda, enhance external sector stability, and secure essential financing for sustainable growth. Key reforms will expand the tax base, address circular debt, and restructure state-owned enterprises. The IMF forecasts GDP growth at 3.2% and inflation at 9.5% for FY25, alongside a primary surplus of 2% of GDP.

Pakistan has also secured $12 billion in bilateral loans from China, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE, boosting investor confidence. The EFF has strengthened external financing, with foreign exchange reserves at around $15.98 billion. The current account deficit has decreased significantly, driven by a 44% increase in remittances. The PKR has stabilized around 277-278, benefiting from a favorable outlook.

The government has launched its first buyback program for Treasury Bills (T-Bills) at PKR 500 billion, reflecting surplus funds and reduced borrowing costs due to falling interest rates. This buyback aims to improve public debt and support privatization efforts, including the potential sale of Pakistan International Airlines.

On the energy front, the government is negotiating with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to revise Power Purchase Agreements, targeting reduced capacity payments. However, substantial changes may deter future foreign investment.

Despite signs of recovery, challenges persist, including rising taxes and declining real wages affecting consumer purchasing power. Political tensions are escalating as the ruling coalition seeks support for constitutional amendments, raising concerns about democracy. Additionally, regional conflicts and a fragile law and order situation pose risks, particularly regarding global commodity prices. As Pakistan faces these challenges, the focus remains on effective policy implementation for sustained growth.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for September 2024 dropped to 6.9%, down from 9.6% in August, marking the lowest rate in 35 months. Core inflation (Urban) also declined, reaching 9.3%—the lowest in 28 months—compared to 10.2% the previous month. Inflation is expected to decelerate further in the coming months as the base effect becomes more pronounced, with CPI anticipated to average around 9% -10% for FY25.

In September, short-term secondary market yields fell by an average of 190 basis points (bps), while longer-term yields decreased by 290 bps. This yields eased due to State Bank of Pakistan reduced policy rate by 200 bps as compared to market expectation of 150 bps -200 bps which resulted in downward trend of yields for the rest of the months and reflects market expectations of further anticipated rate cut of 150 -200 bps in the upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for November 04, 2024. On September 18, 2024, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) held a Treasury bill auction with a total maturity of PKR 113 billion, surpassing the target of PKR 475 billion. The recent developments in government debt management highlight a significant liquidity position for the government, largely due to the substantial dividend of over PKR 2.5 trillion received from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). This influx of cash allowed the government to reject bids in the debt auction, as it had already met its funding targets for the quarter.

The auction for fixed coupon Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) held on September 17, 2024, was notably robust, with a maturity of PKR 534 billion, far exceeding the initial target of PKR 200 billion. The SBP accepted bids totaling PKR 41.6 billion for 2-year bonds, PKR 26.4 billion for 3-year bonds, PKR 26.0 billion for 5-year bonds, and PKR 17.0 billion for 10-year bonds, at cut-off rates of 13.98%, 12.90%, 13.40%, and 13.14%, respectively. These results indicate strong investor demand for government securities, even amid a declining interest rate environment. The varying cut-off rates reflect differing investor sentiment based on the maturity of the bonds, with shorter maturities attracting higher yields, likely due to the prevailing economic uncertainty. Overall, this scenario underscores the government's favorable liquidity position and the ongoing adjustments in the debt market.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent levels and remain at level of 7% -9% on a consistent basis due to stability in currency along with favorable base effect. Monetary easing is expected to continue going forward potentially resulting in a reduction of 4%-5% in the policy rate over the next Fiscal year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program, any abrupt devaluation of PKR, volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict remain significant risks to our forecasts.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

In September 2024, the KSE-100 index saw significant momentum driven by positive economic developments. The month started with single-digit inflation at 9.6%, the lowest in 34 months, boosting investor optimism for a potential rate cut in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. Following this, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) reduced the policy rate by 200 basis points to 17.5%, marking the largest cut since April 2020.

The positive market trend was further strengthened by the IMF’s approval of a $7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) on September 25, leading to the disbursement of the first $1 billion tranche. Consequently, the KSE-100 index reached a record high of 82,248 points, though profit-taking led to a close below 82,000. Average daily trading volumes were 147 million, down from 160 million in August. Notably, foreign investors shifted from net buyers to net sellers, offloading $54.84 million in September.

The SBP’s foreign reserves rose to $9.5 billion, reflecting a month-on-month increase, and the Pakistani Rupee appreciated against the US dollar to settle at 277.71. Ultimately, the KSE-100 closed September at 81,114 points, gaining 2,626 points (3.3%) for the month and 2,669 points (3.4%) for the quarter, supported by the IMF program, declining inflation, and a stable PKR.

The equity market remains an attractive investment option due to historically low interest rates, enhancing stock market performance. Although corporate profitability has risen, stock valuations have yet to fully reflect these gains, largely due to economic conditions and uncertainty. The market is undervalued, with a P/E ratio of 4.01x compared to a 10-year average of 7.37x, indicating significant re-rating potential.

With expectations of currency stabilization and improved external account management, the market is poised for decent gains in FY25. Additionally, Pakistan's recent three-year IMF program is expected to promote fiscal discipline and a stable macroeconomic environment for investments.
