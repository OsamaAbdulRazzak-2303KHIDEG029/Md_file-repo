Fund Managers' Report July 2017

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The current account deficit widened in 4QFY17 to USD 4.4bn thereby bringing cumulative FY17 deficit to USD 12.1bn vs. USD 4.9bn in FY16 (a decrease of 147% YoY) highest level in 9yrs. The deficit as a percentage of GDP has risen to 4% in FY17 as compared to 1.7% in FY16. The remittances also went down by 3% YoY to USD 19.3 bn. Import bill is showing no sign of relief as import payments continue to mount by 14%YoY in FY17, reaching an unprecedented high of USD5.1bn in Jun’17. On a positive note, Foreign Direct Investments in Pakistan have broken its declining trend (+4.6% YoY) since the start of FY17 mainly on the back of initiation of mega power and infrastructure projects under CPEC and strengthening business confidence in the country. Petroleum group imports having the largest share (21%) in the import bill surged by 17% YoY in FY17 due to robust demand from transport and power sector. Ramped up infrastructure activity across the country along with initiation of CPEC projects has fueled demand for machinery import payments which grew by 10% YoY in FY17. State Bank in its latest monetary policy (22nd July 2017) announcement has decided to maintain the policy rate at 5.75% on the back of low inflation environment and positive momentum in domestic demand. Consumer Price Index for Jul’17 increased by 2.91% YoY as compared to 3.93% YoY in Jun’17 and 4.12% YoY in Jul’16 on the back of controlled food prices and fuel prices. Worsening of external sector numbers is a challenge to the country’s economic managers as heavy IMF debt repayments are due in FY18 and could adversely affect the Rupee Dollar parity that has largely remained stable in FY17.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of July, money market witnessed a massive liquidity influx owing to maturity of PIBs and T-bills of approx. PKR 1.3 Trillion. Concentration of market participants remained mostly tilted towards short term especially in 3 and 6 months tenure. In the first T-bill auction SBP raised PKR 545billion against the target of PKR 650 billion cutoff were maintained at 5.99%, 6.01% and 6.04% for 3, 6 and 12 months respectively. During the second auction, massive participation of PKR 1.1 trillion was witnessed out of which a total of PKR 1 trillion was mopped thus entire excess liquidity was picked up by the SBP. In the PIB auction, SBP witnessed limited participation of PKR 75 billion against the target of PKR 100 billion, out of which majority of participation was witnessed in 3Y followed by 5Y and 10Y. The cutoff yields were maintained at 6.40%, 6.89% and 7.9% for 3, 5 and 10 years respectively.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

During the month of July the market lost 1.2% MoM, (555 points). During the period the marker was faced with a lot of headwinds, due to a) political uncertainty JIT related news flow and Panama case decision b) pressure on USD/PKR parity with deteriorating external accounts. Average trading volumes of KSE-100 index declined by 15% MoM in July-2017 and stood at 87mn shares compared to 103mn shares in June 2017, with political ambiguity keeping investors on the sidelines. Furthermore, anticipated foreign inflows related to Pakistan’s up gradation to MSCI EM have so far not materialized largely owing to concerns on an overvalued currency. Foreigners once again were net seller in July (USD 38 mn) as they opted to reduce their exposure on all major sectors. Oil and Gas sector demonstrated the highest return of 10.3% MoM in July 2017 on the back of improving oil prices (10% MoM-Brent and 9% MoM-WTI). Commercial Banks were negative (-4.1% MoM) due to lower inflation numbers and therefore a delayed in interest rate reversal also, certain unconfirmed rumors surrounded HBL which caused the index heavy weight to post a lackluster performance. On the local front, Insurance companies remained the largest net buyers (USD 39 mn) followed by Banks/DFIs (USD 21 mn) while Mutual Funds were the net sellers (USD 31 mn). Though heightened political noise may continue to create choppy markets in the near term, a broader buy into CPEC, improved law & order situation and low oil prices keeps the economy on stable footing. This should reflect positively on the long term prospects of equity markets. The market in the short/medium term may remain range bound however any positive news flow regarding political certainty will be viewed as positive by market participants.
