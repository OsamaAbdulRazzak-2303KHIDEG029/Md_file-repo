Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Macroeconomic landscape improved drastically over FY15. As agreed with the IMF, Pakistan’s reform program was prioritized as the government increased utility prices to combat circular debt and curtail subsidies. The government also divested its stake in United Bank Limited, Habib Bank Limited, Allied Bank Limited and Pakistan Petroleum Limited – which also helped improve foreign exchange reserves.

Well-timed privatization and Eurobond issuances pushed foreign exchange reserves from USD 14.1bn to USD 18.2bn – up by 29%. The rise in reserves was also helped by 63% drop in Arab light crude, which had a trickledown effect on reserves via trade and current account. Cheaper oil caused import bill to fall by 1.5%, which in turn pushed trade deficit lower by 28%. Current account balance resultantly improved by 34%. Better external accounts and reserves kept the currency in check as the PKR lost only 3% against the greenback as opposed to historical depreciation of 4-5%.

Headline inflation clocked in at 4.56% for the entire year. In addition to high base effect, disinflation was primarily led by fall in food / commodity prices. Improvement of macroeconomic indicators led Moody’s to upgrade Pakistan’s sovereign credit rating from Caa1 to B3. With the government focusing aggressively on privatization, spending, fiscal consolidation and energy reforms, further macroeconomic improvement can be expected over FY16.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

On account of record low inflation, the central bank reduced the discount rate by 300bps over the year. With inflation under control, the SBP aimed at boosting aggregate demand and demand for loanable funds. This easing cycle brought down bond yields by 430bps (3Y), 371bps (5Y) and 306bps (10Y).

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. Barring unforeseen circumstances, we expect the market to remain range bound over the next six months as interest rates are largely expected to stay flat over this period. The easing cycle has certainly bottomed out and the outlook now depends on stability in oil and food prices.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The benchmark index gained 16% in FY15 compared to 42% in FY14. Volumes (KSE-100) remained largely flat at 140mn/day, while value traded improved by a decent 26% to USD 90mn/day. Trading activity was more diversified this time around as substantial price appreciation was witnessed in second-tier and third-tier stocks. Sector wise analysis reveals that automobiles, cements and electricity enjoyed the most success among heavy-weight sectors. Automobiles appreciated by 94% on the back of margin accretion and 29% rise in 4-wheel sales. Cement sector observed 47% appreciation on account of 3.5% volumetric growth and prospects of higher construction spending. The electricity sector appreciated by 63% on account of attractive dividend yields amidst falling interest rates. On the other hand, Oil & Gas sector lost 25% value owing to fall in crude prices, while commercial banks lost 6% value at the exchange owing to falling net interest margins.

In terms of net investment at the bourse, mutual funds took the lead with net buying of USD 122mn, while Banks/DFIs were the biggest net sellers at USD138mn. Foreigners invested a net amount of USD 39mn over FY15, compared to net inflow of USD 262mn in FY14 and USD 553mn in FY13. Despite a rise in capital gain tax in budget, the equity market will likely remain upbeat on account of improving macroeconomics, successful negotiations with multilateral partners, improving perception among foreigners, healthy corporate earnings, higher aggregate demand and better business climate. Inclusion of Pakistan in MSCI EM Index and upgrade to B3 category by Moody’s shall also highlight and elevate the bourse on the international platform. Most of the ingredients for a buoyant market remain in place for FY16%.
