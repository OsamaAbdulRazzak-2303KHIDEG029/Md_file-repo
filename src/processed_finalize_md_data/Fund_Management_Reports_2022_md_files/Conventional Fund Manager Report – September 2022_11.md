Fund Managers' Report September 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps. Reduction in energy and major commodity prices will be a real boost for Pakistan which will ultimately result in reduction in the import bill and consequently Current Account deficit. Moreover, this will provide a much needed respite to FX reserves.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

The Current Account posted a deficit of $1.9 billion for 2MFY23 as against a deficit of $2.4 billion during the same period last year. For the month of Aug’22, the CAD shrunk to $703 million as against $1.2 billion in July 2022, largely on the back of shrinkage in trade deficit. Moreover, there was a surplus in financial account due to $1.2bn receipt from the International Monetary Fund. Remittances recovered during Aug’22, increasing to USD2.7bn (+8% m/m).

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity increased from the level of $218.60 to $228.45. The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the last monetary policy decision held on 22 August 2022, SBP maintained the policy rate at 15%. The motive behind the status quo was expected moderation in domestic demand and lower import bill witnessed in Jul-2022. Going forward, market expects SBP to keep the policy rate unchanged at 15% in the upcoming monetary policy on October 10, 2022.

Inflation for the month of September clocked in at 23.2% YoY, mainly due to surge in Food prices because of widespread floods that have devastated crops and farmlands, contributing 11% of the overall YoY inflation.

Secondary market yields for short term instruments up to 3 months decreased by an average of 23bps, while yields for 6M to 12M decreased by an average of 15bps and 16bps respectively. For longer tenors, yield for 5 and 10 years increase by 12bps and 25bps respectively.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions in the month of September with a target of PKR 2500 billion compared to maturity of PKR 2996 billion. In the first T-Bill auction, an amount of around PKR 88.77 billion was accepted, while cut-off yields stood at 15.79%, 15.85% and 15.94% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures. In the second T-Bill auction, an amount of PKR 104 billion was accepted at the cut-off yield of 16.00%, 16.00% and 15.99% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures, respectively.

In the PIB auction, bids around PKR 241.5 billion were realized for 3-years, 5-years and 10 years tenures at cut-off yield of 13.92%, 13.39%, and 12.95 respectively whereas no.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 fell by 2.9% during the month of September to close at 41,128.67 points. The average daily volume decreased by 38.7% on MoM basis as it clocked at 94.19mn compared to previous month’s level of 153.70mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$14.59mn compared to a net outflow of US$8.82mn in August, where the buying was concentrated in Oil and Gas Exploration Companies (US$3.09mn) while there was net selling in Cements amounting to US$2.32mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Changes atop finance ministry, Mr. Dar’s reputation precedes him with the PKR beginning to strengthen even before his formal appointment as finance minister b) Inflation for the month of September clocked surprisingly low at 23.2% compared to average street consensus of ~26%. Decline in electricity prices was key reason for the decline (c) the ongoing declining trend in global oil prices bodes well for Pakistan. Ex-Refinery prices of MS have declined 20% from high made in Jul-22.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 63.19% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases decreased substantially by 60% to close at 3.47k at end of the month, compared to 8.55k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Technology & Communication companies contributed the most to the index i.e. 332 points due to appreciation of USD. On the contrary, Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 711 points.

Macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
