Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report December 2016

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s fiscal deficit stood at 4.6% of GDP compared to government’s target of 4.3% (deficit of 5.3% recorded in 2015). The yearly deficit improvement was due to PKR 516bn increase in tax collection as there was significant imposition of various additional duties and taxes, and PKR 1,263bn decrease in debt servicing expenditure, despite domestic debt expanding by PKR 1,469bn owing to low interest rate environment.

Pakistan’s current account deficit decreased to USD2.5bn a decline of 7% YoY. Even though there was a decline in oil prices, which pushed down oil import bill by 36% to USD 7.6bn, the country did not benefit, as non-oil imports were up 79% YoY and deteriorating textile exports (-7.4% YoY). The external account remained relaxed with total FX reserves reaching USD23.1bn in FY16 (SBP reserves at USD18.1bn), despite a slowdown in remittances and a 9% YoY rise in imports FYTD. This resulted in a stable PKR/USD parity even though IMF program concluded.

The CPI inflation for Dec-16 clocked in at 3.7% YoY, compared to 3.8% in Nov-16. The inflation decreased by 0.7% MoM. A substantial drop of 11.6% in Perishable food item prices was the primary reason for a low inflation December 2016. 1HFY17 average inflation is at 3.9% vs 2.1% in the 1HFY16. The SBP expects that the recent increase in oil prices is temporary as even after the agreement between OPEC and NON-OPEC to cut output, supply surplus would remain. In 2HFY17 it is expected that the average inflation will be around 4.25% to 4.5%.

The confidence due to MSCI and CPEC projects and improved corporate earnings growth outlook for the country. As infrastructure & energy projects.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The bond yields for the month of December continued the upward trajectory due to absence of major interest from market participants partially due to year end where liquidity is usually a concern and partially because the market anticipated a possible upward change in the Policy Rate. Rising international oil prices, widening trade and current account deficits and a perceived overvalued currency were the main reasons why investors shied away from the medium- long term bonds.

The YoY CPI for December 2016 stood at 3.70% which was lesser than that of the previous month’s 3.81%. The inflation decreased MoM by 0.67% as prices of perishable Food Items declined. Inflation for the 1st half of FY17 clocked in at 3.9% compared to 2.1% YoY in 1HFY16. Going forward, it is expected that the era of benign inflation will not last and average inflation for 2nd half of FY17 is expected to clock in around 4.5%.

The federal government rejected all the bids in the auction for Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) as most of the bids for the long-term investment bonds were submitted with higher margin compared to previous auction and the bids were scattered and not concentrated. This was the third auction in a row for long-term bonds, which was rejected by the federal government.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) accepted an amount of PKR 149bn (face value) against bids of PKR 301bn (face value) in the MTB auction held on Wednesday December 08, 2016. The Auction target was PKR 150bn while the maturing amount was PKR 81.8bn. The bidding participation was recorded in 3M (75%), 6M (24%) 12M (1%). The yield for 3M, 6M and 12M tenors stands at 5.9463%, 5.9471% & 12M Bid Rejected respectively.
