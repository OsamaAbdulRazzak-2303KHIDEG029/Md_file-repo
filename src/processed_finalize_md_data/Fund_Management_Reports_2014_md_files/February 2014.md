February, 2014

Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI numbers for February have come in at 7.93% YoY, as another MoM dip in perishable food prices kept the monthly CPI number stable YoY. Cumulative 8MFY14 CPI numbers now stand 8.7%. We project inflation during the remaining 4MFY14 to remain at ~8.0%, with FY14 average clocking in at around 8.5%, much lower than SBP’s revised projection of 10-11%, but marginally higher than government’s projection of 8.0%. Meanwhile, on the external side, January’s current account number stood at negative USD464mn versus a positive USD283mn in November, showing a swing of USD747mn. 7MFY14 current account deficit numbers now stand at USD2,055mn as opposed to USD441mn witnessed in the CPLY, mainly due to lower CSF receipts.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

With a 2% real interest rate (DR at 10%), we expect status quo in this month’s monetary policy statement. In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The recent auction, the government sold Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) worth PKR247bn, more than four times SBP’s target of Rs60bn it had set. Therefore, while the DR may remain stable, secondary market yields appear volatile. Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After four strong months of MoM rises, the KSE-100 index came in for profit taking in February and declined 3.7% during the month to close at 25,783 points.

Average traded volume during the month at 140.8 million shares was 25% lower than the previous month. Corporate results announced during the month were a mixed bag as certain results exceeded market expectations, especially PSO which has already achieved its full year expected earnings in the first half. However, key corporate results also came in significantly below expectations, including NBP, NCL, Hubco, and Kapco. Moreover, net foreign inflows also declined to USD10mn in February versus USD32mn in January.

With the result season now over, we expect political developments and foreign flows to determine market direction going forward.

## Fund Activity

IGIMMF generated a MTD return of 8.24% and YTD return of 7.78% for the period under review.

During the month, the fund opted to increase its placements with DFI's and Banks. This allowed reduction in volatility from T-Bill revaluation spikes. In addition, the above par rates at which the placements were booked, allowed for improved accrual to the bottom line. T-Bills were maintained in the short term tenures, which further provided protection against reval volatility.

Going forward, IGIMMF will aim to increase its duration as secondary yields are expected to remain relatively stable in the mid term papers. The fund will roll over its DFI/Bank placements if the rates offered offer a premium to the market.

## Fund Activity

During the month, IGIIF generated an MTD return of 7.52% and YTD return of 7.84%. With expectations of a stabilizing interest rate environment, the Fund started building up its PIB portfolio during the month. However, the government's huge appetite for funds resulted in an uptick in bond prices in the last PIB auction which led to a mtm loss for the Fund. A significant portion of the fund is placed with banks in order to aid the fund in generating a stable return. Going forward, the Fund intends to increase its weighted average maturity and further increase holdings in government and corporate bonds.

## Fund Activity

During the month, IGIAIF generated an MTD return of 6.62% and YTD return of 7.00%. With expectations of a stabilizing interest rate environment, the Fund started building up its PIB portfolio during the month. However, the government's huge appetite for funds resulted in an uptick in bond prices in the last PIB auction which led to a mtm loss for the Fund. A significant portion of the fund is placed with banks in order to aid the fund in generating a stable return. Going forward, the Fund intends to increase its weighted average maturity and further increase holdings in government and corporate bonds.
