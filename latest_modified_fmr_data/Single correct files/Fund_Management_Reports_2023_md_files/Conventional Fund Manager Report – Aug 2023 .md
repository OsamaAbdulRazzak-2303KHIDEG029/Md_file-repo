## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

Foreign exchange reserves increased to US$13.17bn at end of August, compared to US$12.94bn at the end of last month. PKR depreciated during the month by 6.4% to close at an all-time low level of 305.54 compared to the greenback, as the caretaker setup looked to implement IMF’s condition of keeping the Interbank rate closely linked with the open-market rate.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Inflation for the month of August clocked at 27.38%. Food and Transport remained the major contributors to the monthly change. Non-perishable food prices including sugar and wheat continued to increase in response to increase in support prices and rising inflation. Increased petrol prices contributed to increase in the Transport segment.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till January 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the impact of budgetary taxes, increase in utility tariffs and fresh PKR devaluation may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to raise policy rate in the upcoming meeting considering that the high inflation is expected to persist as high energy and utility prices along with fresh devaluation of PKR will continue to exert pressure on inflation readings.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

SBP held two T-Bill auctions during the month of August, with a target of PKR 2,700 billion against the maturity of PKR 2,977 billion. In the first auction, amount of PKR 1,185 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.90%, 22.75% and 22.98% for 3-month, 6-month and 12 months’ tenure respectively. In the second auction, an amount of around PKR 1,969 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.88% and 22.94% for 3 months and 12 months’ tenures.

In the PIB auction, bids amounting to PKR 80 billion were realized for 3-years and 5-years at cut-off yields of 19.35% and 15.95%, whereas bids for 10 years were rejected. No bids were received for 15 years, 20 years and 30 years’ tenures.

The Central Bank is scheduled to conduct its next monetary policy meeting on September 14, 2023. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to raise policy rate considering that the high inflation is expected to persist as high energy and utility prices along with fresh devaluation of PKR will continue to exert pressure on inflation readings. This view is further substantiated by the Treasury Bills auction held on September 06, in which the cut off rates for 3M and 12M T-Bills increased by 162bps and 213bps compared to previous auction.

Keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Monetary Policy Committee, as it will continue to remain vigilant and assess its stance to achieve price stability.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a negative return of 6.3% during the month of August to close at a level of 45,002 points. The average daily volume decreased by 12% on MoM basis as it clocked at 164.8mn compared to previous month’s level of 186.4mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$18.15mn compared to a net inflow of US$18.15mn in June, where the buying was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$6.43mn) while there was net selling in Fertilizers amounting to US$0.86mn. On a monthly basis, Automobile parts & accessories contributed most to the index i.e. 40 points. On the contrary, Commercial Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 540 points.

The index displayed a positive return of 1.1% in first half of August as investors remained excited on news of circular debt resolution, positively impacting the index heavyweight sectors including Oil & Gas Exploration and Marketing. Moreover, decent results posted by the Banking sector along with hefty dividends kept the Banking stocks in limelight. However, the sentiments soon turned negative and selling pressure was witnessed as economic woes took toll over positivity in the bourse. Continuous devaluation of PKR under the caretaker setup, current account deficit for the month of July, rising petrol and utility prices, all in aggregate elevated concerns over inflation going forward and increased chances of interest rate hike in the upcoming monetary policy meeting, thus investors opted for profit taking.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till January 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the impact of budgetary taxes, increase in utility tariffs and fresh PKR devaluation may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

We believe, realization of massive investments from friendly countries and expectations of commencement of monetary easing from last quarter of fiscal year 2024 can potentially spark a decent rally in the market. Moreover, valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of less than 4x compared to long term average of close to 8x.
