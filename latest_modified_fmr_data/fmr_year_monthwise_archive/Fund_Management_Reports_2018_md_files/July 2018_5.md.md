Fund Managers' Report June 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Growth of large scale manufacturing (LSM) slowed during April to just 4.14% YoY, which brought the 10MFY18 growth to 5.76%. Compared to the previous month, LSM Index declined 16.08% in April mostly due to a contraction in the Pharmaceutical and Iron and Steel Industries. In its rating update issued in June, Moody’s downgraded the outlook on its rating for Pakistan (B3) to “Negative” from “Stable” previously. The update, however, stated that Pakistan continues to have robust growth potential due to ongoing improvements in energy supply and physical infrastructure. On the other hand, the World Bank in its report issued in June commented that Pakistan’s growth in FY19 is likely to moderate to 5.0% (against 5.8% estimated for FY18) due to tighter policies to improve macroeconomic stability. Going forward, the trade war between USA and China may also affect Pakistan due to its trade with China. Inflation was recorded at 5.21% YoY in June, which is the highest since October 2014. CPI growth is expected to remain north of 5.5% for the remainder of the year due to the base effect as well as high fuel prices. Going forward oil prices are expected to remain at an elevated level due to the upcoming sanctions on Iran, which will affect a majority of the 2.5m b/d of oil that Iran currently exports. Pakistan’s external position remains precarious, with foreign exchange reserves at USD 16.2bn (SBP reserves under USD 10bn), which is about 2x import cover. Moreover, PKR depreciated by 5.1% during the month to reach PKR 121.4972/USD. In order to stabilize the external position, the government is considering several options. The interim government cannot make a long-term commitment like entering into an IMF program; hence, it is currently considering other solutions, for example borrowing from China. Moreover, the GoP remains upbeat over attracting foreign exchange through its amnesty scheme, the deadline for which has been extended till the end of Jul’18. According to news sources, revenue worth PKR 80-100bn has been generated through this scheme by the end of June.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In Jun’18, GoP raised cumulative PRs1.37tn from the two T-Bills auctions held during the month, significantly higher than PRs506.3bn in May’18. The cut-off yields for 3M and 6M tenure were 6.75% and 6.85% respectively. That said, bids in 12M tenure were rejected during both the auctions, this indicates continuing expectation of another interest rate hike in the upcoming monetary policy (SBP raised key policy rate by 50bps to 6.5%, and DR to 7.0%). Participation in PIBs auction continued to trim to PRs3.8bn in Jun’18 (vs. PRs6.86bn in May’18 and PRs35.4bn in Apr’18) while cut-off yields for 3YR, 5YR and 10YR tenure stood at 7.50%, 8.47% and 8.70% respectively during the month. Interest in floating PIBs (with yields accepted at 50bps over benchmark rate) seems to have lost steam ahead of expectations of further rate hikes down the lane. During the month of June, Money market remained stable due to frequent OMO injections (last OMO - PKR 1,460bn @6.53%). Moreover, the short-term secondary market yields inched up slightly due to selling from mutual funds owing to higher rates offered by commercial banks at the quarter end. Banks borrowed at 60-75 bps above the T-Bill yield on average, depending upon the rating profile of the bank. Going forward, inflation is likely to increase owing to hike in oil prices & swelling current account deficit. After a recent round of currency depreciation and pressure on FX reserves, another hike of 25 to 50 bps in a discount rate is eminent in the next MPS.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market continued to decline for a third consecutive month in Jun’18 with the KSE-100 Index going down by 2.2% on the back of high political noise, Balance of Payments concerns and foreign selling. Market participation, however, recovered post Ramadan with daily turnover rising by 24% MoM to US$ 61mn (Avg. US$ 74mn in FY18). Hefty foreign selling in Banks and Cements maintained FPI outflow in Jun’18 at US$ 74mn, taking FY18 outflow to US$289mn. The KSE-100 lost 10% in FY18 (US$-based decline: 22.5%), this was first negative return in KSE100 index in the past 9 years. Devaluation in PKR was the biggest reason behind the decline in both Cement and Automobile Sectors as imports make a significant portion of their costs. PKR depreciated by 5.1% during the month of June, worsening fears related to Pakistan’s external position, and creating jitters amongst importers. Apart from Cement and Automobile Sectors, Engineering (Steel) Sector was also a big contributor to the Index’s losses. On the other hand, Fertilizer Sector buoyed the Index due to a continuous rise in Urea prices, which in turn was due to gas supply and subsidy issues. Towards the end of the month, Pakistan avoided being blacklisted by the FATF which would have had adverse repercussions for Banks in particular. According to news reports, the country is headed towards shortage of Urea by the end of July, which may keep prices at an elevated level. Going forward the successful transition to an elected government, and the possibility of a new IMF program, will determine the direction of the market. Formal elections campaigns have kicked off ahead of the Jul 25’18 general elections that are mainly a contest between PML-N and PTI. Key province remains Punjab that accounts for 50%+ of directly contested NA seats, and momentum appears to be with PTI as PML-N faces defections. A decision in the NAB references against ex-PM Nawaz Sharif is a potential major event ahead of elections. Furthermore, successful revenue and foreign exchange generation through extension of the amnesty scheme may boost market sentiment in July.
