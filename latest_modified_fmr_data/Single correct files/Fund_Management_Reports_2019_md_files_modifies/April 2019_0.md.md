Fund Managers' Report April 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The economy witnessed the impact of tightened monetary policy in the second half of the year, as evident from large scale manufacturing numbers that are down by 1.72% YoY in 8MFY19. The slowdown was witnessed across the board as Autos, Iron & Steel, Pharmaceuticals, and Petroleum indices fell during the month of February. This can be directly attributed to the higher inflation numbers and a weakening rupee, both of which continue to contain domestic demand. CPI and CPI Core for the month of March clocked in at 8.8% and 7.0% respectively, on the back of rise in prices of food items, housing, transport and education indices. SBP projections contain real GDP growth for FY19 at in between 3.5-4%, much lower than the 5.2% witnessed in FY18.

Fiscal position continued to worsen while overall forex reserves as at 26-April fell to US$ 15.7bn, considerably lower than US$ 17.4bn recorded at March end. However, PKR remained relatively stable during the month as Current Account numbers showed improvement over the past 3 months, but the situation remains tense as the current reserves barely constitute an import cover of little over 2 months. The latest data by SBP shows that the CAD for Mar19 clocked in at US$ 822mn up from US$ 278mn in Feb19, but down from 873mn in Jan19. Exports during the first 9M FY19 remained flattish YoY, while imports went down 4.9% YoY. The trade deficit in 9MFY19 stood at US$ 21.3bn, lower than its last year’s level of US$ 23.1bn while remittances went up to US$ 16.1bn from US$ 14.8bn during SPLY.

Going forward, Pakistan is now likely to continue negotiations with the IMF for a bailout package under the leadership of Mr. Hafeez Shaikh. The tightening monetary measures like i) rising interest rates and ii) higher inflation (which SBP estimates will be between 6.50 -7.50 % for FY19) will continue to limit economic growth in the medium term. We anticipate exports to grow in 2H FY19 given cost competitiveness. Current account deficit is likely to be further supported by lower imports growth in FY19 compared to last year.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of Apr2019, the bond market remained relatively active compared to previous months. The recent bond auction held in the last week of April’19 witnessed a massive interest as the total participation amounted to PKR 559 billion compared to the target of PKR 100 billion. Majority of the participation was witnessed in 3Y (44%) followed by 5Y (29%) and 10Y (25%) respectively. Out of total bids of PKR 249 billion in 3Y, the central bank only accepted PKR 158 billion at 12.20% (3bps down from the last auction) while rejecting 5Y and 10Y completely.

SBP conducted T-bill auctions twice during the reviewed month. Market participants took aggressive bets in 3 months and a cumulative amount of PKR 4.40 trillion was witnessed in fortnightly auction. Central bank restricted the take up amount to PKR 1.015 trillion, owing to which yields were sharply adjusted downwards by 12-15 bps in the secondary market.

Going forward, with the recent developments in Ministry of finance, central bank and on-going talks with IMF with regard to the funding requirements and structural changes in economic policy; a decisive policy action will be needed where an increase in DR and change in exchange rate regime cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index closed in the red territory for the third successive month, and recorded a decline of 4.83% in Apr19 to close at 36,784 pts, after already having been dented by 5% cumulatively in Feb-Mar 2019. Average daily turnover in Apr19 clocked in at 95.83mn witnessing a sharp increase of 38% as compared to the previous month. During the period under review, the net foreign inflow amounted to US $3.55mn as compared to a net foreign outflow of US $17.8mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in Cements (US $5.5mn) and Commercial Banks (US $2.15mn), whereas there was considerable selling in Power Generation (US $2.42mn), and in Oil & Gas exploration (US $2.15mn).

The index further slid in the month of April due to prevailing political and economic uncertainty. Investor confidence further dampened due to a poor result season in Cements, Steel, and Autos. Hasty cabinet reshuffle along with the removal of Asad Umar as the finance minister has kept the investor community at bay. In addition, the 50bps hike in the discount rate by the SBP resulted in further correction of the highly leveraged companies.

On a monthly basis, Oil & gas exploration sector contributed the largest to the decline with 336 points on the back of a halt in the Kekra drilling activity. The decline in profitability of the cement sector and hike in the discount rate led to the sector contributing negative 321 points to the index. Pharmaceutical sector also corrected by 239 points as DRAP took regulatory measures to control the hike in medicine prices.

Investors remain wary of another rate hike in anticipation of continued monetary tightening on the back of widening fiscal deficit. The advent of the new advisor to PM on finance and economic affairs, Dr. Hafeez Shaikh, will finalize the long impending IMF program in May, 2019. Hence, the much awaited entry into the program and its underlying terms could likely provide some clarity to the investors and a direction to the equity market.
