Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for September clocked in at 7.7% YoY, slightly higher than expectation due to one off 8.5% MoM hike in transportation services. Surprisingly, perishable food items did not witness any significant upside, despite flooding events in Punjab. 1QFY15 inflation has now come down to 7.5% compared to 8.1% in corresponding period last year.

The external account continued to post weak numbers, with current account deficit clocking in at USD0.6bn versus deficit of USD0.77bn in July. Monthly improvement was led primarily by receipt of Coalition Support Funds (CSF). Current account deficit for 2MFY15 now stands at a hefty USD1.37bn as opposed to USD0.58bn witnessed in the CPLY, mainly due to 55% jump in trade deficit.

The federal policy of pursuing a stronger PKR has apparently negatively affected the external account as imports have risen, and exporters are having a difficult time competing with regional competitors. The monthly trade deficit of FY15 has risen to USD2.1bn versus FY14 monthly trade deficit of USD1.4bn. That said, trade deficit and current account are anticipated to strengthen going forward owing to weakened Pak rupee and lower crude oil prices.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the monetary policy conducted in September, the State Bank of Pakistan maintained the discount rate at 10% to strike a balance between fiscal factors and growth considerations. Although the policy decision did not have any bearing on the money market, secondary market yields climbed, nevertheless, and stayed high during a large part of September as liquidity remained constrained and OMO injections were less generous.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back of unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism. In the T-bill auctions, the State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 205.7bn against T-bill auction target of PKR 250bn. Although the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKR/USD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although cut-off yields were maintained, traded yields rose in the secondary market beyond 10% on more than one occasion owing to the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march.

As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s only PKR 414.7bn (82%). No mop-ups were conducted during the month. The move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

September was marked by de-escalation of the political strife between the government and protestors in the Capital. Reversion to peaceful sit-ins led to resurgence of investor confidence with hefty buying of USD 53mn by foreigners. Recovery in investor sentiments pushed the market to 30,200, but profit-taking was seen on account of Macroeconomic weakness emanating from falling foreign exchange reserves, higher trade deficit, delayed financial assistance (IMF) and depreciating Pak Rupee.

After recording a steep slide and value erosion over August, the equity market appreciated by 4.1% over September. Foreigners and Mutual Funds turned out to be the biggest net buyers, while Banks & DFIs booked profits on purchases made during August. The rally was predominantly led by secondary sectors including Pharmaceuticals and Automobiles. On the contrary, heavy weight Oil & Gas sector remained sluggish on account of falling crude oil prices.

The Oil & Gas Development Company is all set to offer 322 million shares in a secondary public offering, which should be instrumental in setting the market direction in the near future. Next, the government is scheduled to offer Sukuks amounting to USD 500mn to support the external account. Success of these offerings and the political climate should be monitored.
