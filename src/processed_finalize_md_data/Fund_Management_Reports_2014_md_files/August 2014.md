## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI inflation for the month of August clocked in at 6.99% as compared to 7.88% in July. Despite monthly hike of 0.33%, year-on-year inflation clocked in lower than previous month owing to the high base from last year. Although real interest rate has risen to 3%, the Central Bank may opt for an unchanged discount rate in September owing to political noise, pressure on Pak Rupee, and potential slippages in economic reforms.

The first month of FY15 saw current account deficit number rising to USD 454m versus revised deficit of USD 135m in June. The slippage emanated from higher trade deficit, which climbed by 27% MoM. Financial account also saw an attrition of 75% MoM in July, to reach USD 0.2bn.

Going forward, economic headwinds may gain ground as the country is scheduled to repay USD 500m to the IMF and may face delays on the incoming USD 500m tranche from the IMF EFF. We expect pressure on the Pak Rupee to sustain unless the government successfully launches OGDC GDR and Sukuk Bonds in Sept'14 / Oct'14.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Primary and secondary money market yields continued to remain stable over August, adjusting only marginally to liquidity management by the Central Bank. During the PIB auction held on August 12, 2014, the Central Bank observed participation worth PKR 87bn against maturity of PKR 103bn and target of PKR 100bn. Subsequently, the State Bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 87bn with cut-off yields clocking in at 12.51% (3Y), 12.90% (5Y) and 13.35% (10Y).

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The equity market remained mostly bearish throughout the month of August after achieving its all-time high of 30,475 in the preceding month. The bourse remained under pressure during the better part of the month on account of the political problems witnessed in Islamabad since the second week of August. This led to market-wide divestments by individuals, mutual funds and foreign investors. Resultantly, the KSE-100 index receded by 6.3% from its peak in July, and ended lower by 5.7% on monthly basis to close at 28,568 points.

Volume traded / value traded at the bourse witnessed an increase of 20% / 14% in August due to low base effect from July (Ramadan season). All key sectors were in negative territory during the month, with Cement sector particularly underperforming the broader market owing to apprehension of capacity expansions, right share issues and price war in the near future.
