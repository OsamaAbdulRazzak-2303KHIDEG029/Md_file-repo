## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

For the month of Mar’21, Current Account Deficit (CAD) clocked in at USD 47mn, compared to a deficit of USD 31mn in the previous month. This takes the C/A balance in 9MFY21 to a surplus of nearly USD 959 mn, an impressive turnaround from a deficit of USD 4.1bn same period last year. Imports in March rose by 57% YoY to USD 5.2bn, highest level since July 2018. The sharp rise in Imports was mitigated by strong Exports and Remittances, both near their record levels. Exports of US$2.6bn led by the increase in exports of Bed-wear and Knitwear textiles (amid seasonal uptick and a third wave of Covid-19 lockdowns in Europe). Remittances also rose 20% MoM to USD 2.7bn in Mar’21, this monthly increase can be attributed to the onset of the month of Ramadan.

SBP’s forex reserves rose from USD 13.6bn to USD 16.42bn during April 2021 supported by USD 2.5bn received from a Eurobond issue, increasing import cover to a little over 3 months. PKR has appreciated 4.2% against the USD CY21td, where regular inflows from exports, higher remittances and Roshan digital accounts, have been key factors contributing to this strength. Last reported Effective Exchange Rate (REER) rose to 100.4994 (March 2021). We expect currency depreciation to be limited and revert to 3-4% p.a. (LT average) beyond CY21 and expect the REER to remain in the range of 95-100.

Inflation as measured by CPI entered into the double digit territory registering at 11.1%YoY in April 2021, compared to 9.1%YoY in March 2021. The hike in April, came from increase in prices in food segment, along with a quarterly revision in house rent index. Moving ahead, increase in oil prices, surge in overall aggregate demand, and expected power and gas tariff hikes are likely to keep inflation on the higher side till June 2021. Despite these cost pressures our projections suggest an average inflation in the range of 8.5%-9.0% for FY21, due to a lower reading in the first half of the fiscal year.

Pakistan’s economy contracted by 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has now set a GDP Growth target of 3% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. We think the former projection will turn out to be more accurate. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July-Jan’21 taking relevant index up by 7.45% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul-Jan’2021 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

Pakistan Government announced expanding the vaccination drive to citizens over 40 years of age towards the end of the month. Vaccine administration to citizens over the age of 50, and front-line workers has been open since February 2021. Meanwhile, COVID19 active cases continued to rise to touch 90,553 in April, compared to 53,127 on March 31, 2021, a growth of almost 70%. The infection ratio in the new tests conducted touched as high as 11.6% mid of the month, but retreated to 9.63% on 30th April 2021. To control the situation, NCOC re-introduced smart lockdowns in major cities where the positivity ratio stood at 17%.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

For the month under review, the head line inflation increased to 11.1% YoY and 1.03% MoM.

T-Bills in the secondary market witnessed slight decrease in yields across all tenors. On the other hand, PIB yields witnessed significant decrease during the month.

SBP conducted Treasury bill auctions twice during the month. Total cumulative realized amount in both the auctions was PKR 1,415.2bn. Cut off yields stood at 7.4% and 7.6871% for 3 and 6 month tenors respectively whereas bids were rejected in 12 months tenor.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 184.6 billion against the total participation of PKR 199.2 billion. The cut-off of for 3 years, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years and 20 years tenors stood at 9.27%, 9.85%, 10.2499%, 10.4774%, and 10.6074% respectively whereas no bids were received in 30 years tenor.

At present, the monetary policy stance of the central bank seems to be quite accommodative. However, it can only be sustained through controlled balance of payment outlook. With the recent surge in non-oil imports and rising trend in international oil prices, the external pressure will presume with an imminent IMF program.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The bourse remained dull for yet another month as the benchmark index KSE-100 posted a negative return of 0.73% to close at 44,588 points. The average daily turnover decreased by 33.8% on MoM basis as it clocked at 155mn compared to previous month’s level of 234mn. Foreigners remained net sellers this month as well, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$16.92mn as compared to a net outflow of US$8.47mn in March, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$8.22mn) and Power Generation & Distribution (US$3.88mn).

Key developments during the month included a) Third wave of pandemic worsened as daily cases averaged above 5k, while the infection ratio remained above 10% causing concerns of complete lockdown; b) Agreement of stringent conditions between Pakistan and IMF regarding taxes and tariffs; c) Forex reserves as of April 23, 2021, stood highest since Dec 2016, as country raised $2.5bn through Euro Bond issue.

Number of daily covid-19 cases averaged 5k during April compared to 3k during the month of March. The country continued to grapple with Covid-19 as infection ratio crossed 10%. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 717k compared to 605k in the last month. Further, there was an increase in total number of active cases which stood at 90.6k at month end compared to 53.1k in previous month end.

On a monthly basis, Fertilizers contributed the most to the index i.e. 197 points, followed by Commercial banks which contributed 117 points to the index mainly due decent results posted for first quarter. On the contrary, Oil & Gas Exploration contributed negatively to the index the most by 245 points.

Macroeconomic fundamentals, Political noise, Upcoming budget, Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs and Covid-19 infections will determine market direction in the near term.
