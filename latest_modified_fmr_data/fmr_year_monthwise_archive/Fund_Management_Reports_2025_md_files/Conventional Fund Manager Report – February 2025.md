# Alfalah Asset Management Limited Fund Managers' Report

**Date:** February 2025

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The country’s import bill surged by 10.0% year-on-year (YoY) in February 2025, reaching $4.74 billion, while exports declined by 5.6%, totaling $2.44 billion. This sharp contrast widened the trade deficit by 33.4%, bringing it to $2.30 billion. Despite this, strong remittance inflows are expected to support the external account, limiting the impact on the current account deficit.

Encouragingly, the current account surplus for the first seven months of FY25 stands at $682 million, compared to a deficit of USD 1,801 million reported in the same period last year. The State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) foreign exchange reserves saw a $200 million reduction, bringing them down to $11.2 billion, primarily due to payments on external debt. At the same time, the local currency weakened slightly, depreciating by 0.3% against the US dollar, closing the month at 279.7.

Inflationary trends showed some relief, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation dropping to 1.5% in February 2025, the lowest recorded since September 2015. This decline, down from 2.4% in January, was largely driven by base effects. However, core inflation remained unchanged at 8.8%. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to stay in the low single digits, with a slight increase anticipated toward the end of the fiscal year. On average, CPI inflation for FY25 is projected to settle around 5.3%, a substantial decline from the 23.4% recorded in FY24.

Meanwhile, on the fiscal side, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) tax collections witnessed a 26.0% YoY growth in the first eight months of FY25, accumulating PKR 7,346 million.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The fixed-income market experienced an upward adjustment in yields during February, with short-term secondary market yields increasing by 11 basis points (bps) and longer-tenor yields rising by 8 bps. This movement reflected market expectations of a potential status quo in the upcoming monetary policy announcement in March 2025.

In the Treasury bill (T-bill) auction held on February 19, 2025, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) managed maturities worth PKR 371 billion against a target of PKR 350 billion. The central bank accepted bids totaling PKR 141 billion for the 3-month tenor at a cut-off yield of 11.82%, PKR 25 billion for the 6-month tenor at 11.68%, and PKR 79 billion for the 12-month tenor at 11.65%. Compared to the previous auction, the cut-off yields saw an average increase of 26 bps, indicating a marginal uptick in market rates.

Similarly, the Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIB) auction on February 12, 2025, which had a total maturity of PKR 63 billion against a target of PKR 350 billion, saw increased investor participation. The SBP accepted bids of PKR 95 billion for the 2-year bond at a cut-off rate of 11.69%, PKR 8 billion for the 3-year bond at 11.89%, PKR 242 billion for the 5-year bond at 12.39%, and PKR 131 billion for the 10-year bond at 12.79%. These results signaled a moderate upward shift in yields across various maturities.

Looking ahead, stability in the local currency and a favorable base effect are expected to support the inflation outlook, with price levels likely to remain in low single digits over the coming months, albeit with a mild uptick toward the end of the fiscal year. Since June 2024, the SBP has implemented a cumulative 1,000 bps reduction in interest rates, bringing the policy rate down to 12.0% from a peak of 22.0%. Given the significant monetary easing already in place, the central bank may opt to pause further rate cuts to assess the economic impact of previous reductions.

Our base-case scenario suggests that interest rates will remain stable in the near term, barring any unexpected changes in macroeconomic conditions. However, if key economic indicators surpass expectations, there remains potential for an additional 100 bps rate cut in the coming months.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index experienced a volatile trading month, initially facing significant downward pressure before recovering in the latter half. The index opened February on a negative trajectory, shedding 3,954 points (-3.5%) to settle at 110,301 points, largely driven by profit-taking and selling pressure. However, sentiment improved following reports of a $40 billion lending package from the World Bank under the Country Partnership Framework, alongside the commencement of negotiations for an additional $1 billion in climate resilience funding from the IMF. These developments helped the market regain lost ground, with the KSE-100 closing at 113,251 points, reflecting a modest decline of 1,004 points (-0.9% MoM).

Trading activity remained subdued, as average daily volume declined by 22% MoM to 529 million shares, while the average traded value contracted by 26% MoM to $88 million. Foreign investors were net sellers, recording outflows of $28.1 million. Among local investors, individuals also offloaded holdings, leading to net sales of $9.7 million. Conversely, insurance companies, mutual funds, and corporates emerged as key buyers, registering net inflows of $16.2 million, $9.2 million, and $6.3 million, respectively.

On a sectoral basis, investment companies, exploration & production (E&Ps), and technology exerted downward pressure, contributing -834, -582, and -428 points, respectively. In contrast, cement, fertilizer, and power sectors provided a cumulative positive contribution of 1,406 points, mitigating some of the broader market losses.

Looking ahead, market participants will closely watch macroeconomic indicators, particularly in light of the government's efforts to meet Extended Fund Facility (EFF) conditions ahead of the IMF review in March 2025. Additionally, geopolitical developments and the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) monetary policy stance, following recent interest rate adjustments, will be critical in shaping market sentiment.

Despite recent volatility, the market continues to trade at a significant discount relative to historical levels. The forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 7.0x and a dividend yield of 7.8% present compelling valuation opportunities for investors with a medium to long-term perspective. We maintain a constructive outlook and believe that attractive entry points remain for those seeking value-driven investment opportunities.
