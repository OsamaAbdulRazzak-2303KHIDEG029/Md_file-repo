Fund Managers' Report December 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. Most of the countries are facing challenges to cope with multiyear high inflation and interest rates. Domestic inflation is still suffering from adjustments in utility tariffs, weaken currency against USD and increase in food prices which have continued to exert upward pressure on domestic prices and the recent floods which have caused huge supply chain issues destroying crops, human, physical, and livestock capital and has deprived many families of their assets and income. As a result, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps. SBP expects GDP growth for the year to be around 2%.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms). The Current Account posted a deficit of $3.09 billion for 5MFY23 against a deficit of $7.23 billion during the same period last year (down 57%). For the month of NOV’22, the CAD shrunk to $276 million as against $1.92 billion in NOV’21 (down 85%), largely on the back of shrinkage in trade deficit due to decline in imports.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

During the month start on 2nd December, the country made $1bn bond payment to its international lenders thus ending the risk of a near term default. However, there are concerns over the country’s ability to repay its long term debts falling due in the next three years. The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account, ultimately result in reduction in inflation, the import bill and consequently Current Account deficit. Moreover, this will provide a much needed respite to FX reserves.

SBP reserves are at very low level of around $7.7 billion as of November-22, however we expect country’s reserve to be improved mainly backed by IMF program and financing from friendly countries (Saudi Arabia and China) while funding the repayments and CAD continue to be challenge for Pakistan.

IMF’s next review is expected to be held in January, however, it has been slightly delayed as the international lender remained concerned over country’s flood related financial requirements and declining revenue measures because of curb in imports. The Government is trying to negotiate with the IMF, Multilaterals, and friendly countries for aid and to postpone or rollover any debt repayments falling due in the near future.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Debt market continued to see pick-up in yields as government borrowing needs surge. Short term tenor papers saw greater interest as investors wary of longer papers expecting further increase. This is underpinned by uncontrollable inflation (24.5% y/y for Dec’22), depleting FX reserves with no firm commitments from friendly countries and IMF review still in doldrums.

Inflation for the month of December came in at 24.46% YoY, mainly due to surge in food prices on widespread floods that have devastated crops and farmlands; and the increase in electricity tariffs.

SBP conducted two Treasury bill auctions in December (14 and 28). Auctions had a total maturity of PKR 1,665bn and 360mn against a target of PKR 1,350bn and 650bn respectively. In the 14 Dec auction, bids worth PKR1,600/46/18bn were accepted in 3/6/12M tenors at a cut-off yield of 16.99/16.89/16.80%, respectively. Whereas in the 28 Dec auction, bids worth PKR345/5/9.8/bn were accepted in 3/6/12M papers at a cut-off yield of 16.99/16.82/16.85%.

Considering the multi-year high rates, SBP rejected all the bids in the longer papers (PIB auctions). Initially, a target of PKR175bn was set, which wasn’t raised at all. As mentioned in the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), the inflationary pressures have proven to be stronger and more persistent than expected; thus MPC will carefully monitor short term prospects for inflation, therefore, another hike in interest rates in future cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a return of -4.55% during the month of December to close at 40,420.45 points. The average daily volume decreased by 4.89% on MoM basis as it clocked at 86.74mn compared to previous month’s level of 82.7mn. Foreigners remained net seller, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$33.99mn compared to a net inflow of US$2.00mn in November, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial banks (US$42.39mn) while there was net buying in Technology and Communication amounting to US$2.99mn.

Key developments during the month include a) The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Thursday announced increase in the Export Finance Scheme (EFS) and Long-Term Financing Facility (LTFF) by 2% to 13% b) Finance Minister Ishaq Dar on Thursday announced that the price of petrol was being reduced by Rs10 and diesel was being brought down by Rs7.5 per liter c) The overall output of the Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) sector declined by 2.89 percent during the first four months (July-October) of 2022-23 when compared with the same period of last year d) The Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet on Thursday approved the export of 100,000 metric tons (MT) of sugar provided the price in domestic market would not increase from Rs89-90 per kg till January 31, 2023.

On a monthly basis, Miscellaneous and Oil and Gas Exploration companies contributed the most to the index i.e. 456.03 and 145.98 points respectively. On the contrary, Technology and Commercial banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 466.62 and 405.72 points.

Successful quarterly review of IMF and macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR/USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term. However, valuation remains enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of ~4.1x (2023) compared to Asia Pac regional average of 12.9x while offering a dividend yield of ~10.2% versus ~2.8% offered by the region.
