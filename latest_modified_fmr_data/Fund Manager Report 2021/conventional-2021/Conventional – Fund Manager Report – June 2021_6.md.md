## Economic & Capital Markets Review

1-Jun-21 Economic Review & Outlook

For the month of May’21, Current Account Deficit (CAD) clocked in at US$632mn compared to a surplus of US$329mn in same period last year. Increase in imports of 77% on YoY basis outpaced exports growth, resulting in 83% rise in trade deficit compared to same period last year. Current account balance for the current fiscal still shows a surplus of US$153mn in 11MFY21 compared to a deficit of US$4.3bn in the comparable period last year. Main reason for the surplus is extraordinary rise in workers remittances that have averaged approximately US$2.43bn a month in 11MFY21, 29% higher compared to last year.

Forex reserves remained unchanged relative to last month at US$23.3bn. PKR depreciated during the month by 2% to close at PKR157.54. On an overall basis in 11MFY21, PKR has gained 6.67% in 11MFY21 from PKR 168 in June 2020. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) dropped from 103 in April to 102.3 in May and is expected to go further down in June as PKR depreciated this month by 2%. We expect PKR to depreciate by 3-4% on annual basis and expect the REER to remain slightly below 100.

CPI stood at 9.7% in June, compared to 10.9% YoY in May 2021 due to declining food prices e.g. chicken, fruits, pulse etc. providing much needed respite to the overall inflation reading. Average inflation for the year stood at 8.91%. Moving ahead, increase in international oil prices, surge in overall aggregate demand, and any power and gas tariff hikes if declared are key risks to the Government’s target inflation of 8.2% in the next year.

The Government announced provisional GDP growth number of 3.94% for FY2021. LSM Growth posted a whopping growth of 68% in the month of April because of low base in last year due to Covid-19. For 10MFY21, LSM has depicted growth of 13% YoY. This entails a very swift V-shaped recovery in economy compared to last year.

Government’s vaccination drive has stepped up recently, as fully vaccinated personnel registered growth of 60% compared to last month and currently stand at 3.36mn i.e. 1.6% of the total population, while partially vaccinated total currently stands at 14.03mn, so a swift increase is expected in vaccinated personnel in the next month as well. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases declined by 45%, and stood at 31.7k at the end of the month, compared to 57.3 at end of last month. The positivity ratio in the new tests conducted declined to 2.5%.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The CPI inflation stood at 9.7% for the month of June 2021.

State Bank of Pakistan conducted Treasury bill auction twice during June 2021. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 1,904.8 billion at a cut-off yield of 7.2953%, 7.5605%, and 7.67% in 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months’ tenor respectively.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on June 09, 2021 with a total target of PKR 125 billion. Total participation of PKR 376 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5 & 10-year tenor received bids worth PKR 294 billion, PKR 45 billion & PKR 37 billion respectively. State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 153.8 billion in 3 years, PKR 7 billion in 5 years & PKR 99 million in 10 years at a cut-off rate of 8.69%, 9.20% & 9.8390% respectively.

Going forward, as indicated in last monetary policy statement, the policy to remain largely accommodative in the near term and a gradual adjustment will be made in order to achieve the mildly positive real rate once the economy returns to operate at its full capacity. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index posted a negative return of 1.13% for the month of June to close at 47,356 points as investors started profit taking after index hit the mark of 48,987 points after almost 4 years. The average daily turnover increased by 26% on MoM basis as it clocked at 310mn compared to previous month’s level of 246mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$31.86mn as compared to a net outflow of US$43.43mn in May, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$11.66mn) while there was net buying in Cements amounting to US$6.24mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Government announced a growth oriented budget encompassing reduction in duties/taxes and enhanced development expenditure in order to support industry and achieve economic growth; b) Pakistan to remain in FATF grey list until it resolves the last remaining point of the action plan; c) CAD widened to US$632mn for the month of May, causing concerns of high CAD in next fiscal year and simultaneous deterioration in economic indicators; d) Pakistan secured a 3 year trade financing facility worth US$4.5Bn from IITFC to cover costs of essential commodities and e) Resumption in Oil facility from Saudi Arabia.

Number of daily covid-19 cases averaged in the range of 1.2-1.5k during June compared to 3k during the month of May. National infection ratio fell below 2.5% by month end as restrictions imposed by the Government helped in containing outspread of the virus. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 904k compared to 845k in the last month. Further, total number of active cases declined to 31.7k at month end compared to 57.3k in previous month end.

On a monthly basis, Technology & Communication contributed the most to the index i.e. 100 points, followed by Food and Personal Care products which contributed 70 points to the index mainly due to incentives announced in the budget. On the contrary, Commercial Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 411 points.

Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs and revenue collection, macroeconomic fundamentals, and Covid-19 infections will determine market direction in the near term.
