# Q79. What are the benefits of Investing in Mutual Funds?

The benefits of investing in a Mutual Fund are as follows:

- Professional Fund Managers – Your investment is managed by fund

managers who have a high level of educational and professional credentials and appropriate investment managerial experience.

Diversification

Mutual Funds aim to reduce the volatility of returns and the risk by diversification. They invest in a number of companies across a broad section of industries / sectors. With a small investment, an investor can achieve diversification that would have otherwise not been possible if the investor invests directly in those securities.

Liquidity

Open-ended Mutual Funds are priced daily and can be redeemed anytime. This mean that investors can redeem their holdings in Mutual Funds anytime.

Low transaction costs

Since Mutual Funds are a pool of money of many investors, the amount of investment made in securities is large. A small management fee is charged by the company, which if invested directly would have cost an individual investor a lot.

Transparency

Prices of open ended Mutual Funds are Publicly announced daily. The portfolio is also disclosed in the monthly Fund Managers Report.

# How Does Mutual Fund Produce income for Investor?

When a fund invests in debt, it requires interest payments at specific times. A fund investing in the stock of corporation receives whatever cash dividends company pays. Interest payments and dividend income by law must be passed through to the fund’s shareholders i.e. to you. You can even have that income reinvested in more fund shares. In addition, when a fund actually sells a stock or bond that has increased in value, the fund realizes a capital gain. Periodically, the fund will distribute such gains to its shareholders in the form of dividend warrants unless you have instructed it to reinvest the gains.

# What is NAV?

NAV stands for Net Asset Value of a mutual fund. This is the price of one unit of a mutual fund.

# How is NAV Calculated

NAV can be calculated as follows: Assets of the fund – Liabilities of the fund / Number of outstanding units for that fund.

# When is fund NAV is announce?

In Pakistan many mutual funds publish their NAV at the end of every business day.

# Is my principal Protected?

Unlike a bank deposit, the value of your principal can rise or fall. People invest in mutual funds because of the fact they want their principal to rise over time. The value of a fund depends on the value of the securities it owns. Stocks and bonds fluctuate in value and therefore so do mutual funds.

# Can I lose Principal in my mutual fund account?

Because the value of a fund fluctuates, when you sell (“redeem”) your shares, the price may be more or less than what you paid for it. Just as the value of your home doesn’t always stay the same, neither does the value of a mutual fund. If you sell your home soon after you buy it, chances are greater you won’t make a profit. The same is true for mutual funds which is a long-term investment.
