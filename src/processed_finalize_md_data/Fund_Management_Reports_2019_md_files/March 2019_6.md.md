## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The economy started witnessing the impact of tightened monetary policy in the second half of the year, as evident from large scale manufacturing numbers that are down by 2.3% in 7MFY19. The slowdown was witnessed across the board as Autos, Iron & Steel, Pharmaceuticals, Petroleum, as well as Food indices fell during the month of January. This can be directly attributed to the higher inflation numbers and a weakening rupee, both of which continue to contain domestic demand. CPI and CPI Core for the month of March clocked in at 9.4% and 8.5% respectively, on the back of rise in prices of food items, housing and transport indices. SBP projections contain real GDP growth for FY19 at in between 3.5-4%, much lower than the 5.2% witnessed in FY18.

Fiscal position continued to worsen while overall foreign reserves as at 29-Mar improved to US$ 17.4bn on the back of a US$ 2.1bn loan from China, and an additional US$ 1bn from UAE. As a result, rupee stayed relatively stable during the month, closing at PKR140.8/USD at the end of March 2019. However, tensions on the economic front remain high as the current reserves barely constitute an import cover 2 months. The Current Account numbers for Feb -19 showed massive improvement during the month, on the back of falling petroleum imports. The CAD for February clocked in at US$ 356mn down from US$ 873mn in January 2019. Exports during the first 8 month of FY19 remained flattish YoY, while imports went down 1.6% over the same period. In absolute terms exports were down by US$ 12mn, while imports went down by US$ 569mn. The trade deficit in 8MFY19 stood at US$ 19.3bn, lower than its last year’s level of US$ 19.8bn while remittances went up to US$ 14.4 bn from US$ 12.8bn during SPLY. After long, the numbers have started to reflect the improved external account situation but questions still remain on the long-term sustainability of the economy.

Going forward, the IMF bailout package now seems inevitable, as support packages from friendly countries are not big enough to act as a substitute. The tightening monetary measures like i) rising interest rates and ii) higher inflation (which SBP estimates will be between 6.50 -7.50 % for FY19) will continue to limit economic growth for the year. We see exports growing in FY19 given cost competitiveness and see imports growth to be lower in FY19 compared to FY 18.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Money market remained volatile during the reviewed month. Market participants expected another round of hike in a policy rate, owing to the peculiar macro-economic conditions and termed it as one of the preconditions for entering into the IMF stabilization program. It was quite evident from the graph below that the yield curve witnessed a drastic upward shift before the monetary policy.

The anticipated rate hike resulted in low trading volumes in longer duration instruments and market participants were skewed towards short term T-bills. Participation in the latest T-bill auction further strengthened market view as the central bank was able to raise cumulatively PKR 25 billion compared to PKR 2.6 trillion in Feb’19. Participation was only witnessed in 3M tenor with little to no bids received in 6M and 12M tenor.

Participation in fixed and floating rate bond also witnessed the similar trend. The total participation witnessed in fixed rate bond amounted to mere 224 billion out of which only 95 billion was accepted at 12.23% (3Y), 12.64% (5Y) and 13.15% (10 Y). Participation in floating rate bond witnessed a wide range of spread from 70bps to 125bps over the benchmark rate. Total participation amounted to PKR 67 billion out of which PKR 8 billion was accepted at a cutoff rate of 70bps over the benchmark.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The cooling down of Equities continued in Mar, 2019 when KSE-100 index further shed 1.04% MoM with low investor participation as ADTO depicted a shrinkage of 20% compared to Feb, 2019. The Index rested at 38,649 points level (down approx. 405pts) at end of the month with meager ADTO of 69.5mn shares. During the month, the net foreign outflow amounted to US $17.8mn as compared to a net foreign inflow of US $32mn, a month earlier. Oil & Gas Exploration (net outflow of US $14.6mn) and Cements (net outflow of US $2.55mn) were the main activity areas.

With uncertainty still looming regarding much-needed IMF program, not-so-exciting result announcements, and improving risk-free yields, investors preferred to adopt a wait-and-see strategy. On the foreign investors’ front, delay in IMF program and PKR depreciation remained a concern as, despite improving foreign reserves position post receipt of USD 3.1bn from China and UAE, the PKR failed to maintain its ground against greenback. The Rupee lost another 1.6% around end of month with hearsay that further depreciation in coming days is on the cards. The SBP further raised interest rates by 25bps in the MPS announced on last day of the month which, although preconceived, will further raise risk premium for fresh equity investments.

Going forward, the impending entry into IMF program and the underlying terms agreed upon could likely provide some clarity to the investors and a direction to the equity market. In the meantime, the index movement will most likely be range-bound with dry volumes. Sectors benefiting from weaker rupee and rising interest rates such as Banks, Textiles, and Energy should continue to blink on investors’ radars for fresh investments.
