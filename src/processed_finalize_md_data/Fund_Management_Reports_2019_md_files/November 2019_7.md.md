Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report November 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing remained subdued in 3MFY20 taking relevant index down by 5.91% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline. CPI using the new base year, clocked in at 12.67% for the month of Nov’19 whereas inflation stood at 12.30% using the old base year due to sharp increase in food prices, rise in utility tariffs coupled with rising petrol prices.

Pakistan’s GDP growth rate clocked in around 3.3% in FY19, and it is anticipated to fall further to at 2.4% in FY20, according to IMF estimates. However, other macroeconomic indicators have started to show improvement. Foreign exchange reserves increased by ~USD 903 mn during the month to close at USD 15.99 bn as of 29 November 2019. Meanwhile, Rupee maintained its stability, appreciating slightly by 0.3% against USD through the month. Current Account registered a surplus of $99 mn for Oct’19. In contrast, the current account recorded a deficit of USD 1,280 mn in Oct’18. Similarly, CAD stood at USD 1.47 bn for 4MFY20, a massive decrease of 74% as compared to the same period of last year. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Consequently, we expect further improvement in the current account. Exports during Oct’19 showed improvement and increased by 7.3% YoY. Moreover, we believe that an FTA with China can lead to a significant increase in textile exports for Pakistan going forward. Foreign remittances depicted a minor decline of 2.9% YoY for the outgoing month.

During the month, the SBP kept the discount rate unchanged, signaling a peak of the monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate depending upon any inflationary shock going forward. Market activity has been depressed on the back of the CNIC condition imposed in the FY20 budget as retailers remain resistant to registering themselves. Recently, the government has postponed the implementation of this condition for three months in the face of a nationwide strike by traders. However, it may prove to be a temporary respite if the long-term issues are not resolved. Any further positive development on this front is vital to the revival of economy.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During November, money market remained relatively volatile based on mixed sentiment amongst market participants of a possible rate hike versus a status quo which was due at the end of the month. In its latest monetary policy statement, the central bank kept policy rate unchanged at 13.25% citing inflation projection for FY20 to remain broadly unchanged at 11 – 12% despite inflation outruns due to increase in perishable food segment, which is expected to be temporary.

T-bills still remained a favored avenue for foreign investors as evident from SCRA flows. Participation in the latest T-bill auction stood at PKR 482 billion against the target of PKR 500 billion with majority of the participation witnessed in 3-months, followed by 12-months and 6-months respectively. Cutoffs for 3-month, 6-months and 12-months were 13.59%, 13.29% and 13.25% respectively.

Participation in long term bonds stood at PKR 271 billion against the target of PKR 100 billion. Out of total participation majority (PKR 113 billion) was witnessed in 3-Year, followed by PKR 116 billion in 5-year and a miniscule participation of PKR 40 billion was witnessed in 10-year. Cutoffs for 3, 5 and 10 year were 11.80%, 11.45% and 11.35% respectively.

Going forward, market sentiment has begun to gradually improve on the back of sustained improvement in the current account and continued fiscal prudence. However, maintaining an adequate import cover and a possible spike in inflation due to supply disruptions remain the key challenges.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

### KSE-100 Index has continued to rally since the bottom hit in Aug 16, 2019. The index has cumulatively returned 37% from the bottom and return for the month of November stood at 14.86%, closing at 39,287 points. Average daily turnover saw an increase of 49% on a MoM basis as it clocked at 186.2mn in November 2019 compared to previous month’s level of 125.4mn. Foreigners also remained buyers during November as the net foreign inflow amounted to US$ 8.84mn as compared to a net outflow of US$ 12.93mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in Fertilizers (US$ 16.11mn) and Commercial Banks (US$ 14.06mn) while they were sellers in Cements (US$ 13.05mn) and Textiles (US$ 3.94mn).

Rally of the market has continued on the back of revival in the economy. Central Bank has maintained status quo in previous two Monetary policy meetings and maintained discount rate at 13.75%. There has been a decline in long term bond yields by more than 2% from its peak. Macroeconomic fundamentals are improving handsomely as current account deficit for 4MQFY20 has decreased by 74% compared to the same period last year while tremendous discipline has been observed in fiscal space as the Government reported a primary surplus for 1QFY20 after many years of fiscal deficits. This has resulted in substantial rise in investor participation at the bourse, as average volumes have increased cumulatively by 104% during last two months. The investors believe that the monetary tightening is dealt with and hope that any future cut in interest rates would provide much needed impetus to the economy.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed largest to the increase of KSE-100 index with 487 points, amid very good financial results, followed by Oil and gas exploration companies with 359 points while Tobacco was the worst performing sector and dented the index by 60 points. Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals and how quickly the SBP enters into the easing phase of the interest rate cycle will determine the market direction in the near term.
