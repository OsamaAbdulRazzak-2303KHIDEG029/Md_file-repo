Fund Managers' Report June 2017

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

In the last 11MFY17 the current account deficit has further widened to stand at USD 10.64 bn vs. USD 3.2bn in the same period last year. The burden of further deepening of the current account deficit falls upon worsening trade balance (-38.6%YoY) and depleting workers’ remittances (-2.1%YoY) with FDI numbers being the only saving grace (+22.6%YoY) in 11MFY17. Over the period, imports of mineral products which includes oil surged by 26% YoY and machinery and mechanical appliances rose by 17% YoY. This was viewed as a product of economic revival of the country. However, stagnant exports despite various incentives announced by the GP and downshift in support from worker’s remittances, as mentioned above, particularly from GCC countries (62.3% of the total remittances) imbalanced the upsurge in imports. The trade deficit is likely to showcase similar trend with development related imports taking priority particularly those related to CPEC as the government enters into election era and strong global competition continues to hamper exports. Other than Ramadan and Eid related boost to inflows, remittances are likely to follow the same trend and will be dependent on economic recovery particularly in the GCC countries. Further adding to pressure on exports the USD/PKR remained flat for FY17 at around PKR 105. The Worsening external sector numbers and inability to attract FDI inflows pose a challenge to the country’s economic managers as heavy IMF debt repayments are due in FY18.

The CPI for Jun’17 decreased to 3.93% YoY as compared to a rise of 5% YoY in May’17 and 3.2%YoY in Jun’16 primarily due to controlled rise in food prices and reduction in fuel prices for the month of Ramadan. Consequently, FY17 average inflation has pulled up to 4.15% vs 2.94% in same period last year, which is well-below SBP’s full-year target of 6%. It is expected that the SBP is likely to continue defending the PKR, which will necessitate taking on additional borrowing to maintain reserves. Any spike in oil prices will be a major risk not just for reserves but also for CPI.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The central bank maintained the discount rate throughout the fiscal year; the money market remained relatively stable since no major shock was witnessed in inflation. During the period market participants maintained their interest in shorter tenure as opposed to medium to long term. The central bank also kept borrowing requirements at relatively stable level thus maintaining the cutoffs mostly during the period. Going forward, with a slightly higher CPI and the absence of low base effect, an increase in discount rate by 25bps by the central bank cannot be ruled out by the end of 2017.

During the month of June, SBP conducted two T-bill auctions with a cumulative target of PKR 600bn against the maturity of PKR 426bn, the central bank maintained the cutoffs for 3M at 5.99%, 6M at 6.01% and 12M at 6.04%. Taking cue from the previous auction results, market participants participated heavily in 3M, followed by 6M and with the insignificant amount in 12M, thus maintaining their interest in shorter tenure. The auction result of PIB held on 14th June also showed similar trend as the cutoffs were maintained for 3Y, 5Y and 10Y at 6.40%, 6.89% and 7.93% respectively.

Target for the auction amounted to PKR 50bn however the market participants participated heavily by approx. PKR 90bn of which PKR 78bn were accepted. The federal government after a significant period conducted Ijara auction in order to meet fiscal deficit and to facilitate Islamic banking industry with surplus liquidity. The Ijara was pledge against the M1 motorway as the underlying asset. Because of the dearth of Islamic assets participants participated heavily by approx. PKR 167bn out of which federal government accepted PKR 71b at Fixed Rental Rate of 5.24%.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 gave a return of 23.24% in FY17 as compared to 9.84% return in FY16. The major excitement created during the fiscal year in the PSX was of Pakistan’s reclassification into an MSCI Emerging market, from a Frontier Market. On May 25’ 2017, the benchmark KSE-100 index hit an intra-day all-time high at 53,124 points providing an upside of 11% from Jan 1’ 2017. Six companies had qualified for the main MSCI EM index: Engro Corporation, Habib Bank, Lucky Cement, MCB Bank, Oil and Gas Development Company and United Bank. The inclusion of Pakistan in the MSCI EM Index was not as welcoming and Pakistan performed the worst in MTD return charts and was an underperformer in the MSCI Asian EM by 7.7% in Jun’17. Concurrently, to the peak from which the index came crashing down, in just 16 trading sessions until 20 June’ 17, the Index has lost 6,265 points, representing an incredibly steep fall of 12%.

Moreover in June, the market witnessed the maximum volatility and dropped by 8% MoM (4,888 points), recorded the lowest return in the last 27 months, on the back of firstly, heightened political uncertainty (JIT), pressure on USD/PKR parity due to worsening external accounts, co-occurrence of month of Ramadan where market activity is relatively dull along with fiscal year end and an unfavorable stock-market budget. Observing sector wise performance; Multi-utilities, Autos & auto parts and Engineering were top performers in FY17 beating KSE100 by 144%, 76%, & 54% respectively, whereas Telecom, Chemicals and Oil & gas were worst performers, lagging KSE100 by 18%, 18% & 9% respectively. The foreigners remained net sellers offloading their holdings to USD 630 mn in the outgoing fiscal year, however, during the end of June 2017 foreigners became net buyers of USD 8 mn. Mutual funds, companies and NBFCs were net buyers of USD574, 125, and 118mn respectively. Activity in KSE-ALL index remained quite robust as shares traded averaged at 350mn in FY17 vs 208mn in FY16. Average value traded stood at PKR 11.03 bn in FY17 vs. PKR 7.68 bn in the previous year.

The KSE-100 now trades at an approximate forward P/E of 9.5x, at an approx. 19%-21% discount to MSCI EM. Given that the market corrected sharply in June and with foreign investors turning net buyers again over last few weeks, the market should lift gradually in the coming months. Additionally on the positive side SECP made major amendments in margin financing system, in light with longstanding demands of brokers.
