Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report May 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

For the month of April’21, Current Account Deficit (CAD) clocked in at USD 200mn, down by 39% YoY. Slower sequential growth in trade gap alongside a decline in outgoing primary income helped keep the deficit limited. Current account balance for the current fiscal still shows a surplus of USD 580mn in 10M FY21 compared to a deficit of USD 3.2bn in the comparable period last year. C/A balance has received strong support from workers remittances that have averaged approximately USD 2.425bn a month in 10M FY21, 29% higher compared to last year.

Forex reserves rose from USD 22.7bn to USD 23.3bn during May 2021. PKR remained stable, depicting a slight depreciation of 0.61% against the USD during the month of May, closing at PKR154.3988. PKR has gained 8.09% in 10M FY21 from PKR 168 in June 2020. Last reported Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is at 103.3 (April 2021). We expect PKR to depreciate by 3-4% beyond CY21 and expect the REER to remain below 100.

Pakistan’s Inflation reading remained in double digit, as CPI registered at 10.9% in May, compared to 11.1% YoY in April 2021 on the back of rising food prices offset by the decline in the energy tariff. Moving ahead, a low base from last year, increase in international oil prices, surge in overall aggregate demand, and any power and gas tariff hikes if declared are likely to keep inflation on the higher side till June 2021. Despite cost pressures, our projections suggest an average inflation in the range of 8.5%-9.0% for FY21.

The Government announced provisional GDP growth numbers for FY2021, which stood at 3.94%. For the month of March 2021, LSM Growth overshot 22%. During the 9M FY21, LSM has depicted a growth of 9% YoY. This entails that the economy has not only recovered after the major lockdown last year, but it has depicted a very swift V-shaped recovery.

The Government announced expanding the vaccination drive to citizens over 18 years of age during May, in addition to the already ongoing drive for citizens aged 30 & above and front-line workers. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases declined by 36.6%, and stood at 57,336 at the end of the month, compared to 90,553 active cases end of April. The positivity ratio in the new tests conducted declined to 3.72% on 31st May 2021. However, vaccinated citizens (those who have received 2 doses) are still only 1% of the total population.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

SBP announced the monetary policy for the next two months in May and as expected the policy rate was maintained at 7%. The monetary policy committee (MPC) explained that a dovish stance is appropriate to ensure the recovery becomes firmly entrenched. Albeit the supply side shocks and seasonality impact of Ramadan, the YoY the head line inflation remained largely in line with the previous forecast. However, with the increase in electricity tariffs, the numbers are likely to remain elevated over the next few months.

State Bank of Pakistan conducted a Treasury bill auction on May 19th, 2021. The auction had a total maturity of PKR 359 billion against a target of PKR 500 billion. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 1.063 trillion. Out of total participation bids worth, PKR 446 billion were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 532 billion in 6 months, and PKR 84 billion in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 557 billion in a breakup of PKR 205 billion, PKR 329 billion, and PKR 22 billion at a cut-off yield of 7.3492%, 7.6000%, and 7.6898% in 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months’ tenor respectively.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on May 06th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 125 billion. Total participation of PKR 563 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10, 15 & 20-year tenor received bids worth PKR 251 billion, PKR 182 billion, PKR 71 billion, PKR 15 billion & PKR 10 billion respectively. State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 85 billion in 3 years, PKR 76 billion in 5 years, PKR 18 billion in 10 years, PKR 15 billion in 15 years, and 10 billion in 20 years at a Cut-off rate of 8.70%, 9.20%, 9.8390%, 10.40%, and 10.56% respectively.

Going forward, as indicated in last monetary policy statement, the policy to remain largely accommodative in the near term and a gradual adjustment will be made in order to achieve the mildly positive real rate once the economy returns to operate at its full capacity. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index posted stellar return of 8.21% for the month of May to close at 47,896 points on the back of expectations of a growth oriented budget to be announced on June 11, 2021. The average daily turnover increased by 59% on MoM basis as it clocked at 246mn compared to previous month’s level of 155mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$43.43mn as compared to a net outflow of US$16.92mn in April, where the selling was concentrated in Oil and Gas Exploration (US$35.91mn) while there was net buying in Cements amounting to US$32.01mn.

Key developments during the month included a) Central Bank decided to keep policy rate unchanged at 7% in order to spur economic activity; b) National Accounts Committee estimates GDP growth to stand at 3.94% for FY21 and c) ECC approved first tranche of payment to IPPs and d) Pakistan and Russia inked agreement for North-South Gas Pipeline project.

Number of daily covid-19 cases averaged close to 3k during May compared to 5k during the month of April. National infection ratio fell below 5% by month end as the smart lockdown imposed by the Government during Eid days helped in containing outspread of the virus. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 845k compared to 717k in the last month. Further, there was a decrease in total number of active cases which stood at 57.3k at month end compared to 90.6k in previous month end. Registration for Covid vaccine is now open for people aged above 19 years, while it was open for people aged above 30 years in April.

On a monthly basis, Fertilizers contributed the most to the index i.e. 197 points, followed by Commercial banks which contributed 117 points to the index mainly due to decent results posted for first quarter. On the contrary, Oil & Gas Exploration contributed negatively to the index the most by 245 points.

Macroeconomic fundamentals, Political noise, Upcoming budget, Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs and Covid-19 infections will determine market direction in the near term.
