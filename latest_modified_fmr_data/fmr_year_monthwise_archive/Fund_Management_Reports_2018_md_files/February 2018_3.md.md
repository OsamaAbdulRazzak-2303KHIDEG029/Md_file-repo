Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report February 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s large scale manufacturing (LSM) index was down by 1.4% YoY in Dec17 to bring the half year growth to 5.55% YoY compared to 7.2% YoY in Nov17. This is much lower than the growth of 9.64% YoY witnessed in 4M FY18. SBP, however, appears content with the economy stating in its last monetary policy statement that “economic growth is on track to achieve its highest level in the last eleven years”. The current account deficit widened to USD 9.1bn in 7M FY18, as opposed to USD 6.2bn in the corresponding period last year. The deficit in Jan18 expanded to USD 1.6bn, compared to USD 1.3bn in Dec17, on the back of a rise in imports, which in turn was driven by higher oil prices.

Inflation was recorded at 3.80% in Feb18, below the consensus expectations of 4.0%. Going forward inflation is expected to range between 4.0%-5.0% during the remainder of the year partly due to higher fuel prices. Domestic petroleum product prices for HSD and MOGAS have been raised by 14%-15% since Jan18. Moreover, further PKR depreciation is expected to lead to imported inflation, which will keep CPI growth high in the remainder of the year.

The external position continued to worsen during the month, with foreign exchange reserves down to USD 18.4bn in Feb18 from USD 19.0bn at the end of Jan18. GoP is expected to return to the international bond market before the elections in order to stabilize the precarious foreign exchange reserves position. An upcoming tax amnesty scheme expected to be announced may also bolster the country’s USD reserves by attracting the return of assets stashed abroad. Moreover, the upcoming country review by IMF will be pivotal in allowing Pakistan to borrow more from bilateral lending agencies like Asian Development Bank and World Bank. On the other hand, support from privatization proceeds is unlikely as not enough time is left to complete the privatization process before the current Government’s tenure ends.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the month of February, the yield curve shifted upwards owing to the increase in discount rate. Compared to longer tenure, Short to medium term securities adjusted up sharply by approx. 22bps which is evident from the graph below as well. The same was also reflected in the national saving rates which increased by approximately 17bps across all their saving products post DR.

During the reviewed period, SBP raised PKR 1.37 trillion from T-bills auction, the cutoff yields for the 3-month T-bill stood at 6.21% and 6.25% for the first and second auction during the month, whereas the bids in 6 & 12-months were rejected in both the auctions owing to negligible interest from the market participants. For the seventh consecutive month, SBP rejected all the bids in the PIB auction signaling their aversion of increasing longer term debt profile.

Despite frequent injections, yields in the secondary market continued their upward trajectory as market expects a further rate hike in the Discount Rate (DR) in the upcoming monetary policy which is due In the coming month. Taking cue from prevailing secondary market conditions, macroeconomic situation, and declining foreign exchange reserves; a hawkish stance from the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index declined by 1.8% in February 2018 to close at 43,239. Average daily volume during the month stood at 73.99mn shares, a decline of 33% over last month. Fears that Pakistan will be added to Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) grey list kept the investor sentiment lackluster throughout the month. Foreign investors turned net sellers again in February, with net outflow of USD 32.1m, after being net buyers in January with net inflow of USD 85.7m. Cement Sector was the biggest contributor to the Index’s decline, while Banking and Oil and Gas Marketing Sectors also added to the pressure.

Cement stocks, LUCK (-8.77%), MLCF (-22.13%) and DGKC (-13.6%) were among the top contributors towards dragging the index down. Reasons for pressure in the Cement Sector included continued decline in Northern cement prices and rise in Richard Bay coal price. Banks too contributed towards the Index’s decline mostly because of fears related to the pension case against the privatized banks, HBL (+3.19%), UBL (-7.14%), and ABL (-4.06%). Furthermore, positive sentiments following the surprise policy rate hike at the end of January turned out to be short lived. Going forward, Banking Sector’s performance is likely to hinge upon whether or not the policy rate is raised by SBP in accordance with the market’s expectations.

Fears that Pakistan may be added to FATF’s grey list also added to the overall negative sentiment in the market during February. The country is now expected to be included in the list in June, as per media reports. Other reasons for the correction in February included jitters created by Supreme Court’s ruling on the former Prime Minister and its ruling related to regulatory duties. On the other hand, Supreme Court’s direction to not let the Government take windfall levy on oil in the Tal Block case fueled a relief rally in POL (+10.35%), which helped support the Index.

Going forward, expectations related to the last budget to be announced by the current Government and any news related to the general elections are likely to drive the market in the short term.
