SECP ADVISED DOCUMENTS/PAPERS TO BE OBTAINED IN CASE OF LOW-RISK CUSTOMERS:

Regulation 11 (2) (c) of AML/CFT Regulations 2018 provides not to collect specific information or carry out specific measures to understand the purpose and intended nature of business relationship for low-risk customers. It rather allows us to infer the purpose and nature of transaction and business relationship. The FAQs issued by the SECP on AML/CFT framework in March 2019 also provide that information of source of income is required for low-risk customers; however, no specific evidence is required. In this regard, documentation requirement for low-risk customers will be as follows (as given under Annexure I of AML Regulations 2018):

Q84. Is my principal Protected?
Unlike a bank deposit, the value of your principal can rise or fall. People invest in mutual funds because of the fact they want their principal to rise over time. The value of a fund depends on the value of the securities it owns. Stocks and bonds fluctuate in value and therefore so do mutual funds.

Q85.Can I lose Principal in my mutual fund account?
Because the value of a fund fluctuates, when you sell (“redeem”) your shares, the price may be more or less than what you paid for it. Just as the value of your home doesn’t always stay the same, neither does the value of a mutual fund. If you sell your home soon after you buy it, chances are greater you won’t make a profit. The same is true for mutual funds which is a long-term investment.
