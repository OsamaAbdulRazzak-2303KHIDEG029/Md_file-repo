Fund Managers' Report August 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The government announced a phase wise end to lockdown in August as economic activities resumed to near normal levels. However, the full economic potential was unable to be realized during the month due to unusually heavy monsoon rainfall throughout the country. The number of daily new cases has fallen to 300 whereas active cases have depicted a sharp decrease to nearly 9,000 from a peak of 108,000 in early July.

Large scale manufacturing remained depressed in FY20 taking relevant index down by 7.8% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline. However, the index increased by 16.8% MoM for the month of June 2020, depicting revival in the economy.

Foreign exchange reserves increased by ~US$ 244 mn during the month to close at US$ 19.9 bn as of 28 August, 2020, mainly due to multilateral inflows. Consequently, PKR appreciated by 0.4% against USD during the month. Recent monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions can potentially provide further support to the Rupee in next few months.

Current Account registered a surplus of US$ 424mn for July’20 compared to a deficit of US$ 613 mn in July’19. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July’19. Exports during July ’20 showed a decrease of 15% YoY mainly due to fall in demand from the importing countries as a result of the pandemic. Foreign remittances depicted surprising increase of 36.5% YoY for July’20, despite the fact that COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of Expatriates across the globe.

CPI clocked in at a level of 8.2% for the month of July’20 which was in line with market consensus. The level of MoM Inflation was witnessed due to increase in petroleum, electricity and food prices. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP has set the policy rate at 7% to restrict the economic slowdown and enable timely recovery.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

For the month of August, National Consumer Price Index stood at 8.2% YoY. During the month of August, the yields in T-Bills as well as PIBs inched up between 15-30bps across the tenors. This primarily due to the fact that market participants are of the view that interest rates have bottomed out and there is no more rate cut in the near future.

SBP conducted Treasury bill auctions twice during the month. Total cumulative realized amount in both the auctions was PKR 643bn. Cut off yields stood at 7.09%, 7.16% and 7.26% for 3, 6 and 12 months tenor respectively.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 44.85 billion against the total participation of PKR 108 billion. The cut-off for 3-year, 5-year and 10-year tenors stood at 8.20%, 8.45%, 8.99% respectively.

Auction for floating rate bond also held on twice during the month. Total participation was PKR 439.41bn against the total target of PKR 240bn. SBP accepted around PKR 145 billion. The cut-off prices of 3-year/5-year/10-year stood at 100.3511/100.4496/101.0430 respectively.

On Islamic front, SBP conducted a GOP Ijarah Sukuk auction on August 20, 2020. The participation stood at PKR 61 billion within the range of 94.4432 & 100.10. SBP accepted a total amount of PKR 22 billion at the price of 99.60.

So far, central bank has provided much needed stimulus by making successive rate cuts in monetary policies. Now the macroeconomic activities need to pick up post COVID pandemic, in order to accelerate growth in the economy. Thankfully, the country has recovered well during the last month, however, the chances of second wave are still looming in the coming months. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index registered a return of 4.72% in the month of August 2020 to close at 41,111 points, continuing its positive momentum from last month where it posted a return of 14.05%. The average daily turnover saw a rise of 17% on MoM basis as it clocked at 292mn in August, compared to previous month’s level of 250.3mn. Foreigners remained net buyers this month, as the net foreign inflow during August'2020 amounted to US$6.85mn as compared to a net outflow of US$68.3mn in July’2020, led by Fertilizers (US$ 6.39mn) and Cements (US$ 3.24mn).

Key developments during the month included, a) Government signed MoUs with IPPs to resolve the circular debt issue and provide relief to citizens of Pakistan in the form of reduced tariffs; b) Current account surplus in the month of July stood at $424mn which mainly stemmed from unprecedented number for monthly remittances i.e. $2,768 mn and increase in export of goods by 20% MoM; c) Improvement in other macroeconomic fundamentals e.g LSM up 16.8% MoM in June, FDI up 61% YoY depicts revival in the economy d) Supreme Court reserved judgement on GIDC in favour of the government, as Corporates and the CNG sector are liable to pay all the amount outstanding till July 2020.

Number of new coronavirus cases continued to decline during the month of August. Daily cases as at end of the month stood at 300 compared to 841 as at July end. Number of recovered patients as at month end stood at 281k compared to 248k in the last month. This resulted in considerable decline in active cases from 25k in the start of the month to 9k by the end.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed largest to the upside of KSE-100 index with 397 points majorly because of attractive valuations and a good results season, followed by Oil & Gas marketing companies with 208 points due to resolution of circular debt and the new petroleum policy. On the contrary, Fertilizers contributed negatively to the index the most by 215 points mainly due to the court’s decision on GIDC as the sector’s outstanding payable accounts for 36% of the total liability.
