Fund Managers' Report February 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy maintained its growth trajectory throughout February. Current Account registered a deficit of US$ 229 mn for January’21, as compared to a deficit of US$ 512mn in January’20. The main reason for the current account slipping back in deficit after posting surplus for five consecutive months from July’20-Nov’20 is the resumption of monthly imports of more than US$ 4 Bn which indicates pickup in economic activity. For 7MFY21, the surplus is USD 902 mn as compared to a deficit of USD 2544 mn in SPLY. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures, significant PKR devaluation and steps taken for import substitution. Exports during January ’21 showed increase of 2% YoY mainly due to increase in textile and IT exports. Foreign remittances maintained their strong growth and depicted surprising increase of 19% YoY for January’21, despite the fact that COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of Expatriates across the globe.

Foreign exchange reserves remained largely stable and decreased by ~US$ 15 mn during the month to close at US$ 20.1 bn as of 26 February, 2021, mainly due to the current account deficit. PKR remained stable as it appreciated by 1.25% against USD during the month. Expected monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions and inflows through Roshan Pakistan Savings accounts should provide further support to the Rupee in next few months, thus ruling out significant devaluation for rest of FY21.

CPI clocked in at a level of 8.7% for the month of February’21 which was in line with the market consensus. Electricity charges were the key contributor to a higher CPI in February, increasing by ~29% MoM. We believe inflation levels have bottomed out and are susceptible to increase in coming months on back of increasing food, power and petroleum prices. Nevertheless, SBP has kept policy rate unchanged at 7 percent to continue the momentum of economic recovery. Moreover, the bank has indicated that any future adjustments in policy rate will be gradual in nature.

Pakistan’s economy contracted by 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has set a GDP Growth target of 2.1% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. We think the former projection will turn out to be more accurate. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July-Dec’20 taking relevant index up by 8.2% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul-Dec’2020 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

Short-term risks remain due to the second wave of COVID-19. The number of daily new cases has increased to over 1500 whereas active cases have increased to more than 17,000 from a low of 6,000 earlier. Nevertheless, long-term outlook remains bright for the economy as multiple vaccines have proven to be effective against the virus in trials and a public rollout is on the horizon, as the Government is making appropriate arrangements and immunization drive for front-line workers is already underway.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

For the month under review, the head line inflation increased to 8.7% YoY and 1.8% MoM.

T-Bills in the secondary market witnessed slight increase in yields across all tenors. On the other hand, PIB yields witnessed significant increase during the month.

SBP conducted Treasury bill auctions twice during the month. Total cumulative realized amount in both the auctions was PKR 1,437.5bn. Cut off yields stood at 7.1906%, 7.4914% and 7.7908% for 3, 6 and 12 month tenors respectively.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 62.137 billion against the total participation of PKR 257.192 billion. The cut-off of for 3 years, 5 years, 10 years and 20 year tenors stood at 8.9083%, 9.5317%, 99.9927% and 10.54% respectively whereas no bids were received in 15 and 30 years tenor.

At present, the monetary policy stance of the central bank seems to be quite accommodative. However, it can only be sustained through controlled balance of payment outlook. With the recent surge in non-oil imports and rising trend in international oil prices, the external pressure will presume with an imminent IMF program.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE 100 index posted a negative return of 1.12% in the month of February to close at 45,865 points. The average daily turnover decreased by 21% on MoM basis as it clocked at 265mn in February, compared to previous month’s level of 335mn. Foreigners remained net sellers this month as well, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$6.18mn as compared to a net outflow of US$1.82mn in January, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$10.9mn) and Food & Personal care products (US$3.25mn).

Key developments during the month included a) Staff level agreement with the IMF; b) Retention in grey list of FATF until the next review in June; c) Strong results from Cyclicals including Cements, Steel and Chemicals; d) Growth of 11.4% in LSM for the month of December 2020 and e) Decrease in daily covid-19 cases along with rollout of vaccines by the Government. All of the above gave positive signals about future trajectory of the economy.

Number of daily covid-19 cases remained in the range of 1k-1.5k during the month of February compared to more than 2k during first half of January. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 546k compared to 500k in the last month, further, there is a decline in total number of active cases which stood at 22.1k at month end compared to 33.5k in previous month end.

On a monthly basis, Cements contributed the most to the index i.e. 638 points mainly due to announcement of very good quarterly results and prospects of increasing profitability in future, followed by Technology which contributed 225 points to the index. On the contrary, Commercial Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 811 points.

Macroeconomic fundamentals, Political noise, Covid-19 infections, the possible rollout of vaccines & their impact on business operations will determine market direction in the near term.
