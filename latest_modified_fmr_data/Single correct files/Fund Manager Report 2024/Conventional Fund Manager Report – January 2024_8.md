Fund Managers' Report January 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account posted a deficit of US$0.83 billion for 1HFY24 compared to a deficit of US$3.63 billion during the same period last year (down 77%). For the month of Dec’23, the Current account posted a surplus of US$397 million compared to a deficit of US$365 million in Dec’22, largely on the back of increase in exports (up 21% YoY), while imports fell by 4%, leading to a decline in trade deficit by 33% YoY. Remittances for the month of December increased by 13% compared to the same period last year.

On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3 -12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

Foreign exchange reserves increased to US$13.26bn by January 26, 2023, compared to US$12.67bn at the end of last month. PKR has remained relatively stable at the level of 279, as the stern administrative actions taken by the caretaker setup continued to bear fruits.

On the external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in the same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99% YoY to USD19.8bn (27% YoY in volumetric terms).

Inflation for the month of January remained on the higher side as it clocked at 28.3%. Food and Housing indices remained major contributors and accounted for 90% of overall monthly change. Perishable food prices including onions and tomatoes continued to increase in response to rising inflation. While increased electricity charges contributed to the rise in the Housing segment.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of 20s till March 2024, before falling below 20% in the last quarter of the current fiscal year. We expect monetary easing to commence from the second half of the current fiscal year, which is likely to result in 7%-9% reduction in policy rate over 2024.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. The caretaker setup has claimed of a substantial investment by Saudi Arabia, China and UAE in Pakistan over the next 2-5 years. This has the potential to be a material positive development for the country if agreements related to the said investments are signed in the near future. Moreover, the IMF program will provide a framework for financial support from multilateral agencies and help in tackling the external account problems, which the country is expected to face in the next 3 years because of massive debt repayments.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of December clocked at 28.3%. Food and Housing indices remained major contributors to the monthly change and accounted for 90% of overall MoM increase. Perishable food prices including tomatoes and onions continued to increase in response to rising inflation, while increased electricity charges mainly contributed to the rise in the Housing segment and overall high monthly inflation figure.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till January 2024, before falling below 20% in the last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the impact of volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict and increase in gas prices remained a major threat and may result in higher than expected inflation going forward as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

SBP held one T-Bill auction during the month of January, with a target of PKR 225 billion against the maturity of PKR 252 billion. An amount of PKR 55.1 billion for 3-month, PKR 9.8 billion in 6-month and PKR 96.7 billion for one-year was accepted at cut-off yields of 20.50%, 20.40% and 20.23% for 3-month, 6-month and 12 months’ tenure respectively. Cut-off yields were around 100 bps lower compared to last month auction. Also, 12-month T-Bills witnessed significant interest as well this month due to expectation of monetary easing going forward. PIB auction was held on January 16, 2024 having a total target of PKR 190 billion, bids worth around Rs 88.9 billion were realized in 3-years, 54.7 billion in 5-years and 2.8 billion in 10 years at a cut-off yield of 16.80%, 15.50% and 14.50%. However, no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years tenures.

While we expect SBP to remain cautious and hold interest rate constant in the month of January due to high monthly CPI Figure, we expect monetary easing cycle from February 2024 onwards as keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Monetary Policy Committee as it will continue to remain vigilant and assess its stance to achieve price stability.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The Benchmark index, KSE-100 had a slightly negative performance for the month of January, as return for the month stood at -0.76%, while the index closed at a level of 61,979 points. Average daily volume fell by 48% on monthly basis as it clocked at 294.9mn compared to previous month’s level of 564.5mn. During the month, Oil and Gas Exploration, Commercial Banks and Fertilizer were the top performers, contributing 621, 305 and 282 points, respectively.

The month of January witnessed profit booking from foreign investors right before election, as their net selling amounted to US$37.9mn, compared to net inflows in previous month amounting to US$26.7mn. Majority of selling from foreigners was concentrated in Commercial banks, Oil and Gas Exploration and Cement.

The board of The International Monetary Fund authorized a $700 million loan for Pakistan as part of a $3 billion bailout during the month. The proactive approach of settling of circular debt served as a further catalyst for increasing investor confidence. Additionally, the US$ 2 billion rollover from the UAE acted as a sweetener. However, the market was unable to continue its three-month winning run due to political unpredictability and election nervousness.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of 20s till March 2024, before falling below 20% in the last quarter of the current fiscal year. We expect monetary easing to commence from the second half of the current fiscal year, which is likely to result in 7%-9% reduction in policy rate over 2024.

We believe the market to remain stable till election, which are scheduled to be on 8th Feb 2024. Potential monetary easing from the second half of fiscal year 2024, strong corporate earnings and cheap valuations can potentially spark a decent rally in the stock market. Furthermore, valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of 3.56x compared to long term average of 7.8x. Moreover, market capitalization of the KSE-100 Index stands at around USD 33.3bn which is still way below USD 100Bn point when the Index crossed the 53k barrier back in 2017.
