Fund Managers' Report June 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of June 2022 clocked in at 21.32% YoY, mainly due to increase in Food Housing and Transport indices, contributing 84% of the overall MoM change of 6.34%.

Secondary market yields showed mixed movements across different tenors as yields for short term instruments upto 1 month decreased by an average of 49bps, while yields for 3 to 12 months increased by an average of 64bps. For longer tenors, yield for 5years increased by 30bps while yield for 10 years witnessed a decline of 28bps.

SBP conducted T-bill auction on June 29th, 2022. The auction had total maturity of PKR 791bn compared to target of PKR 800bn. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 1,710bn in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 15mn in 6 months’ tenors & PKR 4.5bn in 12 months’ tenor at cut-off yield of 15.23%, 14.80% & 14.9499% respectively.

Auction for Fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on June 23rd, 2022 with a total target of PKR 150bn. The Central Bank accepted bids worth PKR 8bn in 3 years, PKR 101bn in 05 years & PKR 45bn in 10 years at cutoff rate of 13.97%, 13.18% & 13.15% respectively.

The next monetary policy is scheduled on July 07, 2022, where the market expects another hike in the policy rate as inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months, fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 fell by 3.57% during the month of June to close at 41,540.83 points. The average daily volume decreased by 16.3% on MoM basis as it clocked at 96.99mn compared to previous month’s level of 115.88mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$12.48mn compared to a net outflow of US$8.82mn in May, where the buying was concentrated in Technology and Communication (US$4.15mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$8.69mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Approval of Federal Budget by National Assembly, wherein, FBR revenue target was increased to PKR 7.5trn (up 23%) encompassing high taxes on corporates and real estate; b) Hike in petroleum prices including Petroleum Development levy to restart the stalled IMF program; and c) PKR hit new low against USD of 211.9 due to continued pressure on forex reserves on account of high CAD and external debt repayments.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 62% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases increased substantially by 87% to close at 6.32k at end of the month, compared to 3.38k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Oil & Gas Marketing companies contributed the most to the index i.e. 92 points on rumours of circulardebt resolution by the Government and increase in gas prices. On the contrary, Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 1042 points due to excess taxation on the sector imposed in FY23 budget.

Macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
