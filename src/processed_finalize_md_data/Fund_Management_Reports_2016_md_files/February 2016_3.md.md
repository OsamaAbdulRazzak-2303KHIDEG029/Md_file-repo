February 2016

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Inflation remained subdued during the month of February, down 0.25% MoM, due to cut in motor fuel prices and continued depression of perishable and non-perishable food items. CPI for the month was up by 4.02% compared to February 2015 due to a low base effect. We expect inflation to remain subdued going forward and the recent cut in electricity tariffs and significant drop in local petrol prices may force the March inflation number to stand below 4%. The outlook on oil prices is not entirely bullish as supply issues still overshadow the demand forecast and even if the oil producing countries agree on an output freeze, we expect inflation outlook in Pakistan will remain benign for the rest of the year.

External position remained stable during the month and the foreign exchange reserve position along with the exchange rate were little changed. Data released in February showed that the current account deficit could not improve in January despite the sharp plunge in oil prices due to exports falling as much as imports. Going forward, we fear that the fall in exports may continue to undermine the impact of low crude oil prices. One factor that can rescue exports in the coming months is the resumption of uninterrupted gas supply to the textile sector after a period of six years due to import of LNG from Qatar.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

After the SBP maintained the policy rate at 6% at the end of January, both primary and secondary market yields for shorter tenor sovereign T-bills remained mostly unchanged during the month of February, while yields of longer tenor bonds came off due to persistent demand for Government bonds. It is also interesting to note that within Government bonds, focus of participation shifted from 3-year to 5-year, with the State Bank accepting a greater amount for the 5-year bond than for the 3-year bond for the first time since October 2015.

FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism along with the inflation to remain lower for even longer than previously expected. The approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market witnessed significant volatility during February and closed flat, up a mere 0.2% over the month of January. The negative sentiment was driven primarily by general negativity across the globe and lower international oil prices which triggered continuous outflows by foreign investors in the local bourse. Rumors of possible investigations by authorities against industrialists added to the weakness locally. Recovery in international crude oil prices in the latter part of the month helped the equity markets gain back some losses. Foreign investors stood at a net sell of USD 39.5m in February compared to USD 49.8m in January 2016. This selling pressure was largely absorbed by individuals and companies during the month. A decent earnings season where most sectors managed to post QoQ growth also failed to create much excitement among the market participants.

Chemicals and Textiles sectors posted strong earnings growth during the quarter ended December 2015 because of seasonality factor. Other sectors that posted strong QoQ earnings growth were Oil & Gas, Engineering, Electricity and Cements. On the other hand, earnings of most Banks were down on a QoQ basis due to higher provision charges.

Going forward we expect crude oil prices to continue to determine the course of the market. Other drivers for the market in the coming months include developments on Pakistan’s inclusion into MSCI’s emerging market index as well as progress on China-Pakistan Economic Corridor projects.
