Fund Managers' Report February 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing remained subdued in 6MFY20 taking relevant index down by 3.35% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline. However, the relevant index increased 9.7% YoY for Dec’19 which indicates the economy may be on a path to recovery. CPI using the new base year, clocked in at a higher than expected level of 14.60% for the month of Jan’20 due to sharp increase in food prices (especially wheat and sugar), rise in utility tariffs coupled with rising petrol prices.

Pakistan’s GDP growth rate clocked in around 3.3% in FY19, and it is anticipated to fall further to 2.4% in FY20, according to IMF estimates. However, other macroeconomic indicators have started to show improvement. Foreign exchange reserves increased by ~USD 230 mn during the month to close at USD 18.87 bn as of 28 January 2020. Meanwhile, Rupee maintained its stability, appreciating slightly by 0.2% against USD through the month. Current Account registered a deficit of $555 mn for Jan’20. In contrast, the current account recorded a deficit of USD 865 mn in Dec’18. Similarly, CAD stood at USD 2.7 bn for 1HFY20, a massive decrease of 71% as compared to same period of last year. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Consequently, we expect further improvement in the current account. Exports during Jan’20 showed decreased by 9.8% YoY mainly due to strike by transporters which restricted shipments. Therefore, we believe export growth will resume in following months. Moreover, FTA with China can lead to a significant increase in textile exports for Pakistan going forward. Foreign remittances depicted a significant increase of 9% YoY for Jan’20.

Last month, the SBP kept the discount rate unchanged, signaling an end of monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate if there are persistent inflationary shocks. Nevertheless, we believe inflationary cycle has peaked out. Market activity has been depressed on the back of the CNIC condition and changes in taxation policies imposed in the FY20 budget as retailers remain resistant to registering themselves. Any further positive development on this front is vital to the revival of.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

CPI for the month of February stood at 12.4% YoY which is drastically lower than 14.6% YoY in January. Major reasons for relatively lower CPI reading is the deceleration in food inflation and government efforts to ease off the supply disruptions in major food items by clamping down the hoarders and defer the hike in energy tariffs.

During the regular cycle T-bill auction, the central bank was able to raise PKR 293 billion against the maturing amount of PKR 197.7 billion. Cutoff yields for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month stood at 13.4149%, 13.2999% and 13.5199% respectively. In the other T-bill auction conducted during the end of the month, the central bank was able to raise PKR 450 billion against the auction target of PKR 300 billion. Major participation this time was witnessed in 12-month tenure. Resultantly, the cutoff yield for 12-month tenure dropped by 19bps. In the fixed rate bond auction, the central bank received bids worth PKR 126 billion out of which the central bank accepted PKR 60 billion. Cutoffs yield for 3, 5 and 10 year inched up by 30, 20 and 10 bps from their last cutoff to close at 12.05%, 11.40% and 11% respectively.

Going forward, the overall slowdown in world economies due to COVID-19 pandemic resulted in decline in international oil prices. From Pakistan’s prospective, the weakening oil prices is positive. The healthy decline in inflationary numbers coupled with weak oil prices outlook in the medium term have built expectations of the start of monetary easing in the benchmark interest rates.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index posted a negative return of 8.76% for the month of February 2020, after a spree of positive returns for 5 consecutive months. The index closed at 37,983 points as of month end, while the average daily turnover saw a decline of 32% on a MoM basis as it clocked at 114mn in February 2020 compared to previous month’s level of 168mn. Foreigners remained net sellers during the month as the net foreign outflow amounted to US$55mn as compared to a net inflow of US$2.85mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in Technology & Communication (US$ 1.67mn) and Food & Personal Products (US$ 0.23mn) while they were sellers in Oil & Gas Exploration (US$ 16.05mn) and Cements (US$ 15.22mn).

Primary reasons for negative performance during the month were a) Ripple effect of Coronavirus on global equities in addition to entry of the virus in Pakistan which resulted in selling pressure being experienced by the bourse as Foreigners remained net sellers by US$55mn and b) A high CPI at 14.56% for the month of January 2020 (highest ever seen in last 10 years) which caused fears in the market of a delayed interest rate cut. Further, the market also reacted negatively to rumors about harsh measures to be taken by the Government in order to reach its fiscal targets as directed under the IMF program.

On a monthly basis, Oil & Gas Exploration contributed largest to the decline of KSE-100 index with 992 points, followed by Commercial Banks with 575 points while Textile Spinning contributed positively to the index by 10 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals and how quickly the SBP enters into the easing phase of the interest rate cycle will determine the market direction in the.
