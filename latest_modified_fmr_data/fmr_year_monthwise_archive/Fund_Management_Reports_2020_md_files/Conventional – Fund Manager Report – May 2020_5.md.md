## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

After the strict lockdown policy imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic in April, both the Federal and Provincial governments eased restrictions throughout the month of May in order to minimise the adverse effects on the economy. However, coronavirus cases continued to rise with the total tally increasing to around 70,000 cases at the end of the month.

Pakistan’s GDP growth rate that clocked in at 3.3% in FY19, was anticipated to fall to 2.4% in FY20, according to IMF estimates. However, the IMF has now revised the growth outlook to -1.5% in FY20 due to the impact of Covid-19, marking the first possible economic contraction in the country since 1952. In contrast, government is expecting a contraction of 0.3% only for the current fiscal year. Large scale manufacturing remained depressed in 9MFY20 taking relevant index down by 5.4% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline.

Foreign exchange reserves decreased by ~US$ 1,818mn during the month to close at US$ 16.9bn as of May 29, 2020, mainly due to external debt repayments. Consequently, PKR depreciated by 1.8% against USD during the month. However, monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions is expected to materialize in near future which will provide support to the foreign exchange reserves and the Rupee.

Current Account registered a deficit of US$ 572mn for April’20 compared to a deficit of US$ 1,165mn in April’19. Similarly, CAD stood at US$ 3.5bn for 10MFY20, a massive decrease of 70% compared to same period last year. The external account situation had improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Exports during April ’20 showed a decrease of 33% YoY mainly due to imposition of strict lockdown to mitigate local transmission of coronavirus infections. Foreign remittances depicted rise of 1% YoY for April’20.

CPI clocked in at an expected level of 8.22% for the month of May’20 due to decrease in petroleum prices and housing index. In contrast, rise in food prices was witnessed due to Ramadan. We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months due to decrease in demand and lower energy prices. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP slashed the policy rate by a further 100bps to 8 percent to restrict the economic slowdown and enable timely recovery, leading to a total cut of 525 bps in last two months.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the reviewed month, market witnessed another rate cut of 100 bps in policy rate. The Monetary policy committee (MPC) was off the view that the inflation outlook has improved further, on account of cut in domestic fuel prices and the head line inflation will bode well in the range of 7-9% in coming months. It was also revealed that such successive rate cuts were made in view of providing liquidity support to the households and businesses to help them through the ensuing temporary phase of economic disruption. Earlier in the month, market already incorporated around 150-200 bps rate cut in yields. However, higher trend in SPI numbers primarily due to the Ramadan effect, reversed the yields adjustments by 60-70 bps in short term yields while long term yields went up by 25-30 bps.

SBP conducted T-bills auctions twice during month in which a cumulative amount of PKR 617 billion were accepted. The cut-offs of 3M, 6M and 12M were settled at 8.14%/7.80%/ 7.74% in last auction. The 3 months T-bill cut-off took a dip of 24 bps as compared to previous one, however, the 6/12months T-bills cut-off remained merely the same.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 168.85 billion against the total participation of PKR 240 billion. The cut-off of 3year/5 year/10 year stood at 7.64%/8.05%/8.69% respectively.

On islamic front, the book building of Pakistan energy sukuk -II was initiated during the month in which a hefty participation of around PKR 300 billion were witnessed against the total target of PKR 200 billion. The cut-off of the sukuk was set at 6month KIBOR minus 10 bps. SBP also conducted GOP Ijarah sukuk auction after the monetary policy announcement. Likewise previous auction, market witnessed a heavy participation in this auction as well. Against the total target of PKR 75 billion, a total of PKR 114 billion worth of participation was made in this auction. SBP accepted the bids near the target amount at the rate of (6month Weighted average T-bill rate minus 10 bps)

As the inflation for the month of May has settled down to 8.22%, we believe that further reduction in domestic fuel prices will surely make the case of another reduction in discount rate, solely on inflationary numbers. However, any supply side shock specifically in agricultural output due to locust crisis in the region will surely add fuel to the fire of an economic disruption going forward. Owing to this expectation, the long term bonds yields have already been adjusted while short term T-bills still looks attractive at current levels in the near term. We will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to capitalize gains in coming months.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index remained range bound during the month of May 2020 as it declined by a mere 0.53% to close at 33,931.23 points. The average daily turnover saw a decrease of 16.09% on a MoM basis as it clocked at 135mn in May, compared to previous month’s level of 161mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during May'2020 amounted to US$40mn as compared to a net outflow of US$69mn in Apr’2020. Foreign investors remained sellers in all major sectors, led by Commercial Banks (US$ 11.14mn) and Fertilizers (US$ 6.48mn).

Lack of triggers remained the key reason for range bound performance of the index. A further cut of 100bps in policy rate by SBP during the month of May also failed to gain investors’ attention as they expected a higher cut to support liquidity issues of businesses. Cases from Covid-19 continued to rise, as total cases hovered around 70,000 by end of May while daily cases also witnessed a peak of 3,039 on last day of the month. Disappointing result season and subdued economic activity during the month of Ramadan and to control the spread of pandemic didn’t help either to support performance of the bourse.

On a monthly basis, Oil & Gas exploration contributed largest to the upside of KSE-100 index with 206 points as international oil prices continued to recover based on improvement in global oil demand outlook as multiple countries lifted harsh lockdown conditions, followed by Technology and Communication with 154 points, while Commercial Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 444 points as interest rates continued to decline and expectation in the market of further cuts.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals, measures taken in the upcoming budget and resumption of normal business activities will determine market direction in the near term.
