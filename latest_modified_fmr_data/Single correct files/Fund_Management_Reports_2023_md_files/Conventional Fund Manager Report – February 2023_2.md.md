Fund Managers' Report February 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

The overall economic situation of the country deteriorated further as the stalled IMF program and delay in disbursement of funds/loans from multilateral agencies continued to put pressure on forex reserves. SBP reserves clocked at USD2.9bn at the start of Feb’23 (lowest since Feb-14) which is equivalent to an import cover of merely 15 days. Balance of payment crisis and external debt repayments have been the root cause of depletion in reserves. As a result, PKR closed at an all-time low of 285 against USD on March 02, 2023.

The country is in dire need of external flows in order to finance the external debt repayments and current account deficit for the next 2 to 3 years. Resumption of the IMF program can result in Pakistan getting support from friendly countries including China, Saudi Arabia and UAE in the form of new loans, rollovers and investment. On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in the same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99% YoY to USD19.8bn (27% YoY in volumetric terms).

With consistent low level of foreign reserves, SBP has placed stringent control on imports due to which current account deficit remained largely controlled at USD3.8bn (down 67% YoY) in 7MFY23 compared to USD11.6bn during the same period last year. In the remaining fiscal year, the external deficit would remain on lower side amid import restrictions and normalization of export and remittances flows.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Inflation for the month of February clocked at 31.5% (highest in 50 years). Food prices and Transport being the major contributors to the monthly change. It is expected that inflation would remain on higher side for next 6 months due to PKR devaluation and adjustment in petroleum prices and utility tariffs.

In response to rising inflation, the Central Bank conducted an emergent monetary policy meeting on March 02, 2023, in which the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 300 basis points to 20% citing significant deterioration in inflation outlook due to PKR devaluation and recent budgetary measures to increase tax revenue. The average inflation for FY23 is now expected in the range of 27%-29%. Moreover, the MPC highlighted that, the policy rate of 20% has pushed the real interest rate in positive territory on a forward-looking basis.

With all the necessary reforms now being implemented, including market based exchange rate, mini budget to cover shortfall in tax revenue, reduction in subsidies, increase in utility tariffs and hike in policy rate, we believe that the talks with IMF are in conclusive phase and staff level agreement will be reached during the month of March.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of February clocked at 31.5% (highest in 50 years). Food prices and Transport being the major contributors to the monthly change. It is expected that inflation would remain on higher side for next 6 months due to PKR devaluation and adjustment in petroleum prices and utility tariffs.

In response to rising inflation, the Central Bank conducted an emergent monetary policy meeting on March 02, 2023, in which the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 300 basis points to 20% citing significant deterioration in inflation outlook due to PKR devaluation, adjustment in energy prices and recent budgetary measures to increase tax revenue. Moreover, the MPC highlighted that barring unexpected shocks, the policy rate of 20% has pushed the real interest rate in positive territory on a forward-looking basis.

SBP held three T-Bill auctions during the month of February, with a target of PKR1,100 billion against the maturity of PKR1,137 billion. In the first auction, amount of PKR445 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 18.00%, 17.84% and 17.95% for 3-month, 6-month and 12 months’ tenure. In the second auction, an amount of around PKR245 billion was accepted at a cut-off yields of 19.95%, 19.90% and 19.79% for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months’ tenures.

In the PIB auction, bids for 3-years, 5-years and 10-years tenures were rejected, whereas no bids for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years were received.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a negative return of 0.4% during the month of February to close at 40,510 points. The average daily volume increased by 6.5% on MoM basis as it clocked at 102.03mn compared to previous month’s level of 95.85mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$8.48mn compared to a net inflow of US$8.74mn in January, where the buying was concentrated in E&Ps (US$7.21mn) while there was net selling in Technology and Communication amounting to US$1.91mn. On a monthly basis, Power generation contributed the most to the index i.e. 170 points. On the contrary, Oil & Gas Exploration sector contributed negatively to the index the most by 282 points.

The index had rallied to 42,466 points, posting a return of 4.4% in the first 9 days of the month as investors remained excited related to news of revival of the IMF program and circular debt resolution. Investors were largely active in the index heavyweight Energy sector on the rumors of large dividends from government owned entities in order to clear the circular debt stock in gas sector. However, delays in staff level agreement with the IMF and lack of clarity on clearance of existing stock of circular debt rocked investors’ confidence, resultantly the index couldn’t hold on to the earlier positivity and closed at 40,510 points by month end due to continuous selling pressure.

Moreover, in accord with IMF condition to bridge the revenue shortfall, the Government presented a mini-budget, wherein, new taxation measures were adopted including 1% increase in sales tax, increase in FED on cement, sugary drinks and sales tax increase on car CBUs and mobile phones.

Successful quarterly review of IMF and macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR/USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term. However, valuation remains enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of ~3.5x (2023) compared to long term average of more than 8x.
