Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report February 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Inflation for the month of February clocked at 23.06% which declined significantly compared to January 2024's reported inflation of 28.34%, mainly due to respite in food prices and higher base effect. Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels till March 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. We expect monetary easing to commence from second half of the current fiscal year, which is likely to result in 7%-9% reduction in policy rate over the next year.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Elections being conducted on a timely basis was crucial for the country’s stability. The new government is already focused towards successful completion of the current Stand-By Agreement and in talks for a fresh IMF program once the SBA expires in March 2024. Additionally, the new IMF program is expected to provide a framework for financial support from multilateral agencies, aiding in addressing the external account challenges that the country is expected to face in the next 3 years due to substantial debt repayments.

On a positive note, the SIFC platform is anticipated to attract significant investments from Saudi Arabia, China, and the UAE over the next 2-5 years. This has the potential to be a substantial positive development for the country, especially if agreements related to these investments are signed in the near future.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of February clocked in at 23.1% which declined significantly compared to January 2024. Transport, Housing & Electricity segments remained the major contributors to increase in monthly change, while Food segment remained the major contributors to decrease in monthly change. Perishable food prices segment including Eggs and onions started to decrease on MoM basis due to high base impact. Overall, CPI indices remained on stable level on MoM basis with only 0.03% MoM increase.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till March 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the impact of volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict and further increase in gas prices remained a major threat and may result in higher than expected inflation going forward as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions during the month of February, with a target of PKR 780 billion against the maturity of PKR 861 billion. In the first T-Bill auctions, bid worth 58.2 billions were accepted at cut-off yields of 20.44%, 20.40% and 20.08% for 3-month, 6-month & 12-month tenures respectively. In the second T-Bill auction, bids worth Rs. 341.2 billion were accepted at cut-off yields of 21.70%, 20.40% & 20.33% for 3-month, 6-month & 12-month tenures respectively. In the PIB auction, bids worth Rs. 85 billion were accepted in 3-years, 5-years & 10-years tenures at cut-off yields of 16.80%, 15.55% & 14.50% respectively. However, no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years & 30-years tenures. Cut-off yields were around 125bps higher compared to last month auction. Secondary market yields during this month witnessed a surge mainly due to gas price hike approved by OGRA as well as election uncertainty remained during this month.

While we expect SBP to remain cautious and hold interest rate constant in the upcoming MPC during the month of March, we expect monetary easing cycle from April 2024 onwards as keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Monetary Policy Committee as it will continue to remain vigilant and assess its stance to achieve price stability.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The Benchmark index, KSE-100 posted a positive return for fourth month in a row as return for the month of February stood at a 4.19%, while the index closed at a level of 64,578 points. The market continued to remain positive after successfully breaching the psychological barrier of 50,000 in the month of October 2023, after 6 years. The average daily volume experienced a 35% decline on a monthly basis, clocking at 190.5 million compared to the previous month's level of 294.6 million.

Foreign investors remained in limelight, with a net foreign inflow of US$25.7 million, a significant turnaround from the net outflow of US$37.2 million observed in January. Foreign buying was predominantly concentrated in Oil and Gas Exploration, Commercial Banks, and Fertilizer sectors. Moreover, Commercial Banks, Fertilizer, and Automobile Assembler emerged as the top performing sectors during the month, contributing 1,063, 660, and 241 points, respectively.

The successful conclusion of elections by the Election Commission of Pakistan, the formation of a new government, and the emphasis on a new program between Pakistan and the IMF have bolstered investor confidence in the overall economy and the stock market. This positive sentiment is evident in the increase in foreign inflows. Additionally, the rollover of a US$2 billion deposit from the Chinese government served as another positive factor for the market.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels till March 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the impact of increase in utility tariffs may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

We believe, realization of massive investments from friendly countries and commencement of monetary easing from second half of fiscal year 2024 can potentially spark a decent rally in the market. Moreover, valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of 4.9x compared to long term average of 8x.
