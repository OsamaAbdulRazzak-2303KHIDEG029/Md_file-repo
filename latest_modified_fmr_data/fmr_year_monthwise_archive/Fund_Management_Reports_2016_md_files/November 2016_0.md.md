## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI inflation for Nov-16 clocked in at 3.8% YoY, compared to 4.2% in Oct-16 and up from 2.7% witnessed in the corresponding period last year. Among the major items, Food & Beverages, having the highest weight in CPI basket increased by 0.2% MoM, mainly due to 2.5% MoM drop in perishable food items while non-perishable food items augmented by 0.69% MoM. After this fall in YoY numbers, it is expected that monthly inflation to accelerate quickly due to change in base effect, firmed up more due to rise in international oil prices which subsequently led to a rise in local petroleum product prices, will eventually have inflationary pressure.

The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) Saturday’s Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) kept the policy rate unchanged at 5.75%. The MPS noted that ‘CPI inflation has been following a rising trend, with sporadic seasonal diversions’ and ‘core inflation is inching upwards as well’. Foreign Exchange (FX) reserves continue to build‐up reaching USD 23.6bn (USD 18.5bn SBP Reserves) giving support to PKR/USD averaging approximately 104.75 during the month. A key concern in this fiscal year is the 4% drop in remittances in 4MFY17. On the financial account front, FDI decreased by 54% YoY in 4MFY17, but it is expected to improve as Dawlance & Engro Food deal inflow comes in the near term. Despite the higher current account deficit & decline in FDI, SBP reserves are up in 4MFY17 due to rise in multilateral loans and recent issuance of USD1bn Sukuk. Current account deficit increased to USD 1.76bn in 5MFY17 compared to USD 1.08bn in 5MFY16. The country’s import showed growth of +2.1%YoY in 5MFY17, to USD 13.6bn while export declined by 3.2%YoY. As a result, country’s trade deficit stood at USD 6.69bn compared to USD 6.19bn in the same period last year.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In November sizeable activity was witnessed in the PIBs where yields constantly kept rising due to bearish sentiment on inflation going forward, coupled with expected PKR depreciation and worsening FDI and remittances. With an expectation that interest rates have bottomed out and the same may witness some upward pressure in 1st quarter of CY17, most financial institutions preferred to book and realize gains on their longer term bond holdings.

The PIBs yields saw an average increase of 10-14 basis points across all tenors as selling pressure remained high during the end of the month. The yields for latest 3 year PIB floated around 6.30%, the yield for 4 year increased from 6.57% on 1- Nov-2016 to 6.65% in month ended. Also PIBs of longer tenors such as 5, 6, and 10 year were trading around 6.93%, 7.20%, and 8.03% respectively.

The results of the latest T-bill auction of 23-Nov-2016 showed a similar trend as the cut off for 3month and 6 month were maintained at 5.9463% and 5.9471% respectively, while the cut-off for 12 month increased to 5.9485%. The target amount set for the auction amounted to Rs. 250 billion out of which Rs. 295 billion was accepted, thus showing the interest of Financial Institutions on shorter tenors as compared to longer tenors.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market increased by 6.8% (highest since Apr-16) even though there was massive foreign selling (USD 117mn) in the outgoing month. Rise in liquidity, ease of political noise and smooth transition of Army Chief bought the market to new highs. The volumes of KSE-All index increased by 9% MoM in November to 489mn. The value traded increased by 17% MoM to PKR16.3bn as there was more activity seen in small cap stocks. Foreigners sold a net USD117mn in the outgoing month bringing the net outflow in 11MCY16 to USD194mn. FIPI outflow during the month remained skewed towards other sectors, cements & banks. Among the market participants Mutual Funds (USD78.4mn) and Individuals (USD68.3mn) were the biggest net buyers while Foreigners (USD117mn) and Banks/DFI’s (USD68.3mn) books were the major sellers. The major sector performance was witnessed in the Steel, Cement & Textile sector, while Power and Software underperformed the market in the outgoing month in terms of market capitalization change. Majority steel stocks gained due to initiation of antidumping duty and rise in price of both long rolled and flat products. The Cement sector also saw a rise as coal prices decreased its recent peak and monthly volumes also improved. Textile sector also rose due to anticipation of textile package but saw a correction at month end as it got delayed. Top performing scrip’s were NESTLE (+6.58%), SNGP (+21.79%), HBL (+1.3%), BOP (+17.19%), PMPK (+29.9%) and UBL (+1.36%) contributed 237 points cumulatively to the index. However, the weightage of decliners were more during the month that included HUBC (-10.44%), PPL (-9.23%), KAPCO (-11.79%), DGKC (-7.65%), TRG (15.69%), MCB (-3.34%) and ENGRO (-4.16%) which dragged the index down and took away 656 points cumulatively. Sector wise return shows that Multiutilities, Software & Textile sector gained the most among the key sectors, while Telecom, Electricity and Cement declined by the most in the outgoing month in terms of market capitalization change.
