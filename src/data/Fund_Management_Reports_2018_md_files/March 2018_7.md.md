Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report March 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

LSM growth continues with data released in March shows growth of 13.58% YoY in Jan18, taking the growth in 7M FY18 to 6.33%. Outlook too appears stable, as observed by SBP in its monetary policy announcement and IMF. In the first post-programme monitoring report, IMF noted "Pakistan’s near-term outlook for economic growth is broadly favorable. Real GDP is expected to grow by 5.6% in FY 2018, supported by improved power supply, investment related to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), strong consumption growth, and ongoing recovery in agriculture.” External position showed mixed performance in January. Foreign exchange reserves declined by USD 368m to USD 17.9bn, and PKR depreciated by 4.4% to PKR 115.50/USD. On the other hand, the current account deficit improved substantially by 25% MoM in February, with the deficit down to USD 1.2bn only compared to USD 1.7bn in January 2018. Reason for the improvement was a sharp drop in goods imports (from USD 4.9bn to USD 4.3bn). Going forward the current account deficit is expected to improve even further as PKR devaluation is likely to discourage imports and enhance exports. Further, a majority of machinery imports was expected to be made in 2017 and 2018, and such imports are likely to start tapering off towards the end of this year. Inflation was subdued in March, with general CPI up 3.25% YoY only compared to 3.80% in February 2018 and 4.94% in March 2017. The sharp PKR depreciation in Dec17 appears to not have had much of an impact on inflation, which is partly attributable to SBP’s pre-emptive move whereby it raised interest rates by 25bps in January. According to SBP, however, the full impact of its January rate hike is not yet visible. SBP noted in its March’s monetary policy statement that they are of the view that some time may be allowed for the impact of recent policy developments to unfold before they reassess. Given that PKR has depreciated by a further 4.4% in March, which may lead to a building up of the threat of imported inflation, it is likely that SBP will raise rates by 50bps in the coming monetary policy announcement.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Money market remained volatile during March owing to the second round of PKR depreciation of 4% against USD. Following this, market developed a consensus on 25bps rate hike in MPS which was scheduled for the last week of the month, and as a result yield curve shifted upwards. However, in a surprise move, SBP kept the policy rate unchanged at 6% citing that the recent policy measures have started to bear fruit with improvements in exports coupled with moderate inflation and growth in workers remittances despite decline in new labor proceeding abroad. During the month both PIB and T-bill auctions saw muted participation, as PIB auction bids stood at 10 billion. This led to SBP rejecting the entire amount due to insignificant interest. In the latest T-bill auction held on 28th March, market participants tested the waters by participating at higher yields after incorporating their expectation of rate hike by approx. 25bps, however the central bank maintained the cut-offs and refrained from accepting amounts at higher yields. Going forward, market participants will keenly monitor the deteriorating macroeconomic indicators mainly declining FX reserves coupled with constant pressure on the current account which may force the government to take proactive measures which may include PKR depreciation and or an increase in policy rate.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

March 2018 was an eventful month for Pakistan’s equity market as the KSE-100 Index rose by 5.4% to take the total gains to 12.6% for 1Q CY18. The biggest driver of the index was the devaluation of PKR in March. A 4% Devaluation of PKR against the USD led to a rally in Banks. Another important driver of the market was continuous rise in cement prices, which boosted investor sentiment in the sector. Average daily turnover in the market however, declined by 5.4% to 193m shares during the month. Foreign investors were net sellers in the month of March, with an outflow of USD 22.4mn. PKR depreciated by 4.4% during the month of March to stand at PKR 115.50/USD. The depreciation led to an expectations of a rate hike in the monetary policy announcement scheduled for the end of the month; thereby, resulting in a rally in the Banking sector. PKR devaluation also led to a rout in Engineering (also known as Steel) stocks, which undermined some of the Index’s gains from the Banking sector. Both Engineering and Auto Stocks were able to pass on the impact of PKR depreciation to their customers, but market prices of Engineering stocks suffered more than that of Auto Stocks. Cement Sector was the second biggest contributor to the Index’s gain in March due to a steady rise in Northern cement prices throughout the month. Prices have risen in the range of PKR 10-50/bag since February 15, 2018, when the rally first began. In the near future, cement prices in the Northern part of the country are expected to stabilize, while those in the South are expected to face some pressure due to the upcoming capacity expansion in the region in 2018. The much talked about proposed amnesty scheme and the FY19 Federal Budget are the two most important events to watch out for in April 2018, and therefore, are likely to be the key driver of the market in the upcoming months. The proposals released so far indicate that the budget this time will be less aggressive than last year with lower expenditure and no new taxes.
