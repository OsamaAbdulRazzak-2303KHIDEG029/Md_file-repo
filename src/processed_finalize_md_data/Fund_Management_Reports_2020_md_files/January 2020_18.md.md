## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing remained subdued in 5MFY20 taking relevant index down by 5.93% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline. CPI using the new base year, clocked in at 12.63% for the month of Dec’19 due to sharp increase in food prices, rise in utility tariffs coupled with rising petrol prices.

Pakistan’s GDP growth rate clocked in around 3.3% in FY19, and it is anticipated to fall further to 2.4% in FY20, according to IMF estimates. However, other macroeconomic indicators have started to show improvement. Foreign exchange reserves increased by ~USD 715 mn during the month to close at USD 18.64 bn as of 31 January 2020. Meanwhile, Rupee maintained its stability, appreciating slightly by 0.2% against USD through the month. Current Account registered a deficit of $367 mn for Dec’19. In contrast, the current account recorded a deficit of USD 1,881 mn in Dec’18. Similarly, CAD stood at USD 2.15 bn for 1HFY20, a massive decrease of 75% as compared to same period of last year. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Consequently, we expect further improvement in the current account. Exports during Dec’19 showed improvement and increased by 4.7% YoY. Moreover, we believe that an FTA with China can lead to a significant increase in textile exports for Pakistan going forward. Foreign remittances depicted a significant increase of 20.0% YoY for Dec’19.

During the month, the SBP kept the discount rate unchanged, signaling a peak of the monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate if there are persistent inflationary shocks. Market activity has been depressed on the back of the CNIC condition and changes in taxation policies imposed in the FY20 budget as retailers remain resistant to registering themselves. Any further positive development on this front is vital to the revival of economy.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, yield curve shifted upwards as evident from the graph below, the major shift was witnessed in 5-Year tenor which shifted by 36bps. These shifts in yields were in-line with the expectation of higher inflation for the month of January and gradual buildup of interest by the market participants in PIBs.

In the recent monetary policy meeting, the central bank kept the discount rate unchanged at 13.75%. The decision reflected the central bank view that the outlook for inflation has remained broadly unchanged. Despite near term risk of food price shocks and potential increase in utility prices, several other factors are expected to gradually ease the pressure on inflation.

Central bank was able to raise PKR 1.3 billion in the three Treasury bill auctions conducted during the month. Cutoffs for the Treasury bill auction largely remained unchanged with only 3-Month cutoff dropped from 13.4851% to 13.4296%. In the fixed rate bond auction, the central bank raised PKR 22bn, PKR 51bn and PKR 19bn at the rate of 11.75% (3Y), 11.19% (5Y) and 10.90% (10Y) respectively.

As foreign investors find the interest rate differential between Pakistan and other similar economies attractive, the total investment in debt market touched USD 2.5 billion by the end of the month.

Despite improved perception of Pakistan’s credit worthiness for foreign investors, the central bank would have to maintain adequate liquidity buffers to manage any outflows from SCRA going forward.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index posted positive return for the 5th consecutive month as the index closed at 41,631 points (2.2% up). The index has cumulatively returned 45% from the bottom hit in August 2019. Average daily turnover saw decrease of 12% on a MoM basis as it clocked at 168mn in January 2020 compared to previous month’s level of 192mn. Foreigners remained net buyers during the month as the net foreign inflow amounted to US$ 2.5mn as compared to a net outflow of US$ 11.26mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in Fertilizers (US$ 10.52mn) and Oil & Gas Marketing (US$ 6.58mn) while they were sellers in Cements (US$ 4.63mn) and Commercial Banks (US$ 4.51mn).

The market rally was mainly based on valuation re-rating (on macro-economic stability and monetary easing expectations), however, it has recently lost its momentum as KSE 100 index has fallen by 3.67% from its recent high of 43,219 points on January 13, 2020. This was mainly led by higher inflation expectations due to abnormal rise in perishable food prices, thus casting doubts on delay in the monetary easing process. Further, the market also reacted negatively to rumors about a mini-budget being introduced by the Government in order to reach its fiscal targets as directed under the IMF program.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed largest to the increase of KSE-100 index with 529 points, amid expectation of very good financial results, followed by Cements with 184 points while Tobacco was the worst performing sector and dented the index by 101 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals and how quickly the SBP enters into the easing phase of the interest rate cycle will determine the market direction in the
