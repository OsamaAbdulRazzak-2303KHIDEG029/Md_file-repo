Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report January 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy continued its growth trajectory throughout the month of January as well. Current Account registered a deficit of US$ 662 mn for December’20 after a period of five months, as compared to a deficit of US$ 287 mn in December’19. The main reason for increase in the current account deficit is the resumption of monthly imports to US$ 5 bn in December’20 which indicates pickup in economic activity. For 1HY21, the surplus is USD 1131 mn as compared to a deficit of USD 2032 mn in SPLY.

The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures, significant PKR devaluation and steps taken for import substitution. Exports during December ’20 increased by 6.8% YoY mainly due to increase in textile exports. Foreign remittances maintained their strong trend and depicted surprising increase of 16% YoY for December’20, despite the fact that COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of Expatriates across the globe.

Foreign exchange reserves decreased by ~US$ 380 mn during the month to close at US$ 20.2 bn as of 29 January, 2020, mainly due to the current account deficit incurred and foreign repayments. PKR remained largely stable as it depreciated by only 0.2% against USD during the month. Expected monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions and inflows through Roshan Pakistan Savings accounts should provide support to the Rupee, thus ruling out significant devaluation for rest of FY21.

CPI clocked in at a level of 5.65% for the month of January’21 which was below the market consensus. Most of the sequential decline in inflation was on the back of a 2.65% MoM drop in food inflation. On the other hand, house rent recorded its highest MoM increase in recent years. We believe inflation levels will remain low due to a high base effect and government measures to control food prices and crackdown on hoarding. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP has kept policy rate unchanged at 7 percent to continue the momentum of economic recovery, while maintaining inflation forecasts to 7-9%. Moreover, the bank has indicated that any future adjustments in policy rate will be gradual.

Pakistan’s economy contracted by 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has set a GDP Growth target of 2.1% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. We think the former projection will turn out to be more accurate. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July-Nov’20 taking relevant index up by 7.4% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul-Nov’2020 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

Short-term risks remain due to the second wave of COVID-19. The number of daily new cases have now decreased below 2k compared to more than 3k in early December, whereas active cases have increased to 33.5k from a low of 6k earlier. Nevertheless, long-term outlook remains bright for the economy as multiple vaccines have proven to be effective against the virus in trials and a public rollout is on the horizon, as the Government has started to make appropriate arrangements.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the reviewed month, SBP announced the monetary policy for the next two months. As expected the policy rate was maintained at 7% as the monetary policy committee (MPC) viewed the existing stance is appropriate to support the nascent recovery, while keeping the inflation expectations well anchored and maintaining financial stability. On inflation front, the recent out turns was also encouraging owing to the waning of price pressure on foods items. However, the recent hike in utility tariffs could pose a concern on inflation uptick. With an inflation outlook relatively benign, aside of the possibility of a temporary supply side shocks, expectations remains largely aligned to be in the range of 7-9% respectively for FY21.

The yield Curve remained flattish throughout the month as the Monetary Policy expectation of the market became aligned. State Bank of Pakistan conducted Treasury bill auction on January 27th, 2020. The auction had a total maturity of PKR 471 billion against a target of PKR 400 billion. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 773 billion. Out of total participation bids worth, PKR 646 billion were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 106 billion in 6 months, and PKR 20 billion in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 487 billion in a breakup of PKR 382 billion, 99 billion, and PKR 5.8 billion at a cut-off yield of 7.1597%, 7.49%, and 7.7989% in 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months’ tenor respectively.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on Jan 6th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 100 billion. Total participation of only PKR 48.95 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10, 15 & 20-year tenor received bids worth PKR 11.95 billion, PKR 21.5 billion, PKR 11.5 billion, PKR 2 billion & PKR 2 billion respectively. State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 8.8 billion in 3 years, PKR 20.5 billion in 5 years, and 6 billion in 10 years at a Cut-off rate of 8.4999%, 9.5298%, and 9.99% respectively. Bids for 15 and 20-year tenor were rejected.

At present, the monetary policy stance of the central bank seems to be quite accommodative. However, it can only be sustained through controlled balance of payment outlook. With the recent surge in non-oil imports and rising trend in international oil prices, the external pressure will presume with an imminent IMF program.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE 100 index started the year in spectacular fashion, as the index depicted a return of 6.01% in the month of January to close at 46,386 points. The average daily turnover increased by 26% on MoM basis as it clocked at 335mn in January, compared to previous month’s level of 266mn. Foreigners remained net sellers this month as well, as the net foreign outflow during Jan'21 amounted to US$1.82mn as compared to a hefty net outflow of US$96.34mn in Dec’20, where the selling was concentrated in Cements (US$2.45mn) and Oil & Gas marketing companies (US$2.16mn).

Key developments during the month included a) Status quo maintained by the Central Bank in monetary policy meeting, wherein, it was signaled gradual adjustment in the policy rate in order to allow the economy to run at full capacity; b) Signing of final agreements between Government and the IPPs, a significant step towards circular debt resolution; and c) Decrease in daily covid-19 cases and approval of vaccines by the Government. All lifted investor confidence as reflected by increase in participation.

Number of daily coronavirus cases decreased below 2k in the latter part of the month of January compared to more than 3k during start of December. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 500k compared to 437k in the last month, however, there is a slight decline in total number of active cases which stood at 33.5k at month end compared to 34.7k in previous month end.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 535 points, the investors started chasing attractive valuations and dividend yield on offer, followed by Technology which contributed 452 points to the index. On the contrary, Paper and Board contributed negatively to the index the most by 39 points.

Macroeconomic fundamentals, Covid-19 infections, the possible rollout of vaccines & their impact on business operations will determine market direction in the near term.
