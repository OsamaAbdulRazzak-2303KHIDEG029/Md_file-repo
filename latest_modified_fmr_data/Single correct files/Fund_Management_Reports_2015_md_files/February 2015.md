## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for Feb’15 clocked in at 3.24% YoY (11-year low), which was much lower than consensus expectations. The statistic brought down period inflation (8MFY15) to 5.45% compared to 8.65% in CPLY. On monthly basis, CPI was down 0.9%, while core inflation remained flat and pushed annual core inflation to 6.2% YoY. Trimmed core inflation clocked in at 4.2% YoY.

Current account numbers posted a deficit of USD 95mn in Jan’15 as opposed to a surplus of USD 226mn in Dec’14. Trade and Income deficit fell month on month, but a higher decline in worker remittances and other current transfers kept current account numbers in the red. Over 3QFY15, the account is likely to witness a surplus balance due to receipt of USD 0.7bn in CSF payment in Feb’15.

With the prevalent real interest rate at 5.3%, there is ample room for further monetary easing in the upcoming monetary policy statement (Mar’15). Considering global energy demand and surplus, we foresee a stable macroeconomic environment for the remainder of FY15 and remain optimistic on leading economic indicators.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The State Bank of Pakistan brought PIB yields down significantly in the Feb’15 auction, mopping up a total of PKR 73bn out of participation of PKR 265bn (target of PKR 50bn). Cut-offs for 3Y, 5Y and 10Y came off by 39bps, 60bps and 21bps, respectively. The result was indicative of further monetary easing in the Mar’15 MPS. With inflation clocking in at 3.24% for Feb’15. With CPI at its 11 year low, the expectation of a downward revision in the Discount rate by 50-100 bps may cause the market to pull PIB yields even lower than the latest cut-offs in the auction.

The regulator also conducted 8 OMO injections during February to ease overnight liquidity constraints. Interestingly, the Central Bank conducted its first mop-up in more than six months, the mop-up participation amounted to a meager PKR 123bn, most of which was accepted.

The State Bank of Pakistan informed the market of its plans to introduce a target rate, which would be aimed at strengthening transmission of monetary policy, stabilizing overnight liquidity and reducing rate volatility. This will be in addition to SBP Reverse Repo Rate (ceiling rate) and Repo Rate (floor rate), and will be placed between this very corridor. The proposal will be submitted to the Advisory Committee on Monetary Policy in its Mar' 15 meeting for review.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After soaring by 7.2% over Jan’15, the equity market witnessed a cor Weight (%)rection of 2.4% in Feb’15. The decline emanated from hefty foreign selling (highest since Jul’13), despite a strong earning season. Net foreign flows saw an outflow of USD 62.5mn in Feb’15, concentrated mainly in Electricity sector (USD 48mn) and Cement sector (USD 16mn). Mutual Funds remained net buyers once again (USD 41mn). During the month, volumes (KSE-100 index) plunged by 25% MoM to 152mn owing to investor caution.

Sector wise analysis showed Telecom sector, Pharmaceutical sector & Commercial Banks underperformed the most; while Electricity and Automobiles appreciated on monthly basis. All the key banks posted better than expected results, yet underperformed on the bourse owing to expectations that future interest spreads will shrink. Decent dividend payout by independent power producers and anticipation of further monetary easing strengthened the case for the electricity sector. The Automobile sector also closed positive on the back of robust sales for Jan’15 and improving business outlook.

Barring a dismal Feb’15, we remain optimistic on the equity market as the macroeconomic situation continues to improve with subdued CPI and 50-100bps cut projected in the discount rate. Automobile sector, Cement sector, Chemical sector and Electricity sector are anticipated to remain in the limelight going forward owing to strong outlook.
