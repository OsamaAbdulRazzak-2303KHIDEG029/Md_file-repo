Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report November 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The Large Scale Manufacturing Index grew 1.32% MoM and 1.83% YoY for the month of September 2018. The growth will continue to remain tepid with mixed industry trends.

Petroleum industry sales volume continued to decline with sales down by 32% YoY driven by a decline in FO and HSD sales. Cement sales continue to be mixed, growing by 5.3% YoY in 4M FY19, but were down again by 1% MoM in the month of November. Auto sales have also shown no growth in the ongoing fiscal year. November’s monetary policy statement revised the GDP growth target with SBP projecting real GDP growth for FY19 at slightly above 4% compared to 5.8% in FY18. This is largely driven by recent monetary and fiscal measures which have started impacting growth in the economy.

Inflation for the month of November came in at 6.5% YoY, lower than market expectations of 7.4%. The lower number was driven by lower perishable food prices which fell 21% YoY. Core inflation (non-food non-energy) was up 8.3% YoY in November, with lagged impact of rupee depreciation reflected in prices. Recent decline in international crude oil prices (Arab Light down by 20% MoM in November) will help inflation stay low though outcome on OPEC’s December meeting will decide the direction of oil prices going forward. November also saw substantial PKR devaluation once again as with PKR declining 5% to PKR 139/USD.

Pakistan’s external position improved marginally in November with foreign exchange reserves at USD 14.5bn as at Nov 23, 2018 compared to USD 14bn at end of October 2018 reflecting the USD 1bn received from Saudi Arabia. The current account deficit continued to widen in October increasing 34% MoM to USD 1.2bn driven by higher imports of goods (up to USD 4.7bn in Oct vs USD 3.7bn in Sept).

The IMF delegation arrived in Islamabad in November for two-week talks on financial assistance package as requested by the Pakistani government. But no positive conclusion was reached on news that Pakistan refuses to accept tough financial conditions including increasing power tariffs, higher tax collection target and sharing details related to the Chinese CPEC projects. Given that the CPI was above the initial annual target of 6%, SBP increased the policy by 1.5% for the next two months to 10% at end of November which should help curtail inflation. Central bank now projects FY19 inflation to be 6.5%-7.5%. We do not rule out another interest rate hike given near term challenges of high inflation, elevated fiscal deficit and low foreign exchange reserves.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, the yield curve shifted upwards owing to an expectation of rate hike which was due at the end of the month. Activity during the period was mostly concentrated in less than 30 days T-bill as participants shied away from taking exposure in longer tenure, the same was evident from T-bill and PIB auctions as well.

The central bank was able to fetch only PKR 18.78bn in the last t-bill auction, which was much lower compared to PKR 3.3 trillion in October 2018. Cutoff for 3 month T-bill was maintained at 8.80% whereas participation in both 6-months and 12-months were rejected due to negligible participation. Auction for the fixed coupon bond also had thin participation as the total bids received were PKR 13 billion against the target of PKR 50 billion, scattered bids at different levels resulted in entire auction being rejected.

National Saving Schemes (NSS) rates were also increased by approximately 90bps across all the schemes. Going forward, materialization of commitment from our friendly donors and any further PKR depreciation against USD will set the tone for the upcoming MPS going forward.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index declined by 2.8% in November. The bearish sentiment was primarily attributed to deletion of 2 stocks (UBL and LUCK) from MSCI EM Large Cap index, anticipation of strict IMF conditions, disappointing trip of the Prime Minister to China and declining international crude oil prices. Moreover, PKR underwent another round of devaluation during the last trading session of the month where exchange rate closed at PKR 139.06/USD on November 30th. KSE-100 Index’s average daily volume reduced to 118m shares in November from 128m shares in October. Foreign portfolio outflow stood at USD 100mn during November as against USD 86m in October, which is the highest monthly outflow since May 2017. The selling was mainly witnessed in the Banking and Cement Sectors upon exclusion of UBL and LUCK from MSCI EM index and dismal financial performance of HBL and DGKC. It is pertinent to note that it is the 7th consecutive month of heavy foreign outflow in the banking sector.

Oil & Gas E&P companies were the top contributors to the index’s decline upon rising concerns on oversupply post waivers announced for Iran’s top customers. During the month, Arab light prices went down by 21% MoM to USD 60.6/bbl by end-November. This also impacted OMCs which were the second largest contributor to the decline in index. Cement sector also remained a laggard during the month upon dismal 1QFY19 results and an expected hike in policy rate.

Commercial banks declined during the month as heavy selling pressure was witnessed in HBL and UBL. Barring these two, banking sector witnessed a rally during the month ahead of MPS announcement. MCB emerged as the leader with positive contribution in index points during the month ahead of 150bps hike in policy rate in monetary policy. Moreover, the market received support from chemical sector. Textile sector also provided some respite to the market in an anticipation of improved package for export oriented sectors.

Going forward, conclusion on discussions with China and clarity on IMF plan will determine the direction for the market. Moreover, OPEC and non OPEC members are due to meet in December to discuss the output policy for 2019, which is likely to address the raised concerns on oversupply.
