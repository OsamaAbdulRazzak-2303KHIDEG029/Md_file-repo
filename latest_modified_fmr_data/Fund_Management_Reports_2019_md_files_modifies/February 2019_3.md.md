## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The economy started seeing the impact of tightening monetary policy in the second half of the year with large scale manufacturing down by 1.53% in 1HFY19. For the month of December, LSM growth was down 10.19% YoY. In the auto sector, sales were down in most categories including tractors which went down by 26%, trucks by 27% and LCVs by 11% for the 7MFY19 over SPLY. The slowing growth can be seen as a direct result of higher inflation and a weakening rupee, both of which continue to contain domestic demand. CPI and CPI Core for the month of February clocked in at 8.2% and 8.8% respectively, on the back of rise in prices of food items, housing and education indices. The slowing growth in the economy can be seen as a direct result of higher inflation and a weakening rupee, both of which continue to contain domestic demand. SBP projects real GDP growth for FY19 at slightly above 4%.

Fiscal position continued to worsen as foreign reserves went up slightly on the back of inflows from friendly countries – receipts from UAE and Saudi Arabia of US$ 1bn each provided the reserves much needed support during the month of January. Overall foreign reserves went down to US$ 14.9bn by end of January 2019 compared to US$ 18.9bn at end of January 2018. The current SBP reserves constitute import cover of merely 2x. The rupee stayed stable during the month, closing at PKR138.8/USD at the end of February 2019. Exports witnessed a slight increase of 1.6% YoY over the 7MFY19 period, while imports went up 0.38% over the same period. In absolute terms exports were up by US$ 219mn, while imports went up US$ 244mn resulting in an overall deteriorating scenario. The trade deficit in 7MFY19 stood at US$ 17.6bn, almost the same it was in SPLY. Going forward, we feel we are edging closer to the finalization of the IMF bailout package which is likely to dictate the economic direction in CY19.

Friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE and China have already pledged to help Pakistan’s dwindling reserves either in form of depositing reserves, commercial loans, or delayed payments for oil. During the month, UAE and Saudi Arabia contributed US$ 1bn each to Pakistan dwindling forex reserves. We expect these measures to contain the rupee depreciation in CY19 as REER stands at an acceptable 103 at the end of January. However, the tightening monetary measures like i) rising inflation which SBP estimates will be between 7.0-7.5% for FY19 and ii) high interest rates will continue to limit economic growth for the year. We see exports growing in FY19 given cost competitiveness and see imports growth to be lower in FY19 compared to FY18.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period, yield curve shifted downwards owing to interest in longer tenure bonds which is evident from the graph below. Participation in both the T-bill auctions witnessed a massive jump as the central bank was able to raise cumulatively PKR 2.6 trillion compared to PKR 962 billion in January 2019. Major participation during the auction was witnessed in 3M while little to no participation in 6M and 12M paper was seen, cutoff for the 3Month stood at 10.55%.

Post increase in the discount rate, longer tenure bond market witnessed a massive interest from the market participants as both the fixed and floater bonds witnessed overwhelming participation. Total participation in the fixed rate bond amounted to PKR 375 billion of which PKR 112 billion, PKR 49 billion and PKR 59 billion were accepted in 3, 5 and 10 years at the cutoff yield of 12.15%, 12.49% and 12.85%. Participation in floating rate bonds amounted to PKR 164 billion of which PKR 80 billion were accepted at the cut off rate of 70 bps above benchmark rate.

However, the finalization of IMF program would set the future direction of the economy and another round of 25-50 bps hike in the discount rate can be expected in CY19 going forward.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index declined by 4.3% in February 2019 after a sharp increase of 10.1% in January 2019 to close at 39,054. Average daily turnover in Feb 2019 remained relatively flattish and increased by a meagre 2% in as compared to the previous month. During the period under review, the net foreign inflow increased significantly to stand at ~US $ 32mn as compared to US $16.2mn in the previous month as foreign investors remained significant net buyers in cements (US $11.5bn) and commercial banks (US $9.22bn).

The index plunged in the first half of the month due to a hike in interest rates of 25bps as local investors shifted from industrials and companies with high leverage. The investors were waiting anxiously for the finalization of the commitments made by the Saudi crown prince worth USD $21bn, but the MOU signing did not prove to be of material significance to the investor community. The second half of the month was marred by allegations from Pakistan’s eastern neighbor, India, after the Pulwama attack. Geopolitical tensions persisted throughout the month and escalated towards the end of the month when India conducted airstrikes in Pakistan’s territory and Pakistan subsequently retaliated.

Going forward, de-escalation of recent tensions & materialization of peace talks with India is likely to boost the sentiments of the investors. However, an impending bailout package with the IMF and the underlying terms of the bailout package should dictate the direction of the economy and the equity market going forward.
