Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for October clocked in at 17-month low of 5.8% YoY. House rent index saw a rise of 1.4% MoM in October, but decline in Food and Transportation index limited the overall monthly gain to just 0.2%. With headline inflation receding below 6%, the case for policy rate cut in November has now strengthened. In fact, consumer inflation is anticipated to slide even further next month after accounting for the cut in prices of petroleum products. In this regard, unrelenting decline in international crude oil price has been a key influential factor and deserves continued scrutiny by the equity and commodity pundits.

After depicting weakness over July and August, the external account witnessed considerable improvement in September owing to rise in exports, decline in service deficit and higher remittance. Current account deficit for 1QFY15 now stands at USD1.33bn as opposed to USD1.27bn witnessed in the CPLY, mainly due to 36% jump in trade deficit.

In November, economists should see a marked improvement in Forex reserve position after OGDC’s GDS offering and launch of Sukuk Bonds. A successful IMF review should also pave the way for sizeable financial tranche of USD1.1bn.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The Central Bank released new leaner PIB auction targets for 2QFY15 over the first week of October, pushing bond yields down across the board. After auction targets were revised from PKR 100bn to PKR 50bn per month, market participants scrambled to purchase securities from the secondary market at higher prices. Resultantly, PIB yields lost 9 – 18 bps over a matter of days before recovering to Sept-end levels.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The equity market remained in positive territory in the early half of October but dipped slightly as the result season got underway. Quarterly results portrayed mixed trends as investors witnessed some results that were below expectation. Nevertheless, the bourse recovered towards the end of October with the KSE-100 posting a gain of +2.2% to close at 30,377 points.

Monthly gains were led by low-weight sectors including the likes of Automobile, Pharmaceuticals and Telecom. The heavy weight Oil & Gas sector, on the other hand, declined on account of falling crude oil prices.

After six months of consecutive net positive investments (USD 391mn), foreign investors divested USD 31mn in October owing to concerns on global economic outlook, weakened global commodity prices and end of quantitative easing. Local mutual funds (USD8.7mn) and NBFC (USD5.8mn) were the biggest buyers of local equities.

Going forward, the GDS offering of OGDC and international Sukuk offering remain crucial triggers for the bourse. Furthermore, PIB spreads, Coal prices and JPY/USD parity (along with off take) should prove pivotal for Banking sector, Cement sector and Automobile sector – three sectors with tremendous potential – over the coming months.
