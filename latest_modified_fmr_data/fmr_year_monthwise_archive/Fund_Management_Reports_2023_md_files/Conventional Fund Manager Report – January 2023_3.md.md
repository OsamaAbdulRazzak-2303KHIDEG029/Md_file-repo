Fund Managers' Report January

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps. Inflation for the month of January clocked in at 27.6% YoY, mainly due to surge in prices of non-perishable food items and housing, electricity index.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised interest rates by 100bps in the meeting held on 23rd January citing stronger than expected inflationary pressures the key reason for the hike. As mentioned in the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), the inflationary pressures have proven to be stronger and more persistent and MPC stressed that it is critical to anchor inflation expectations, so another hike in interest rates in future cannot be ruled out.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

The Current Account posted a deficit of $3.67 billion for 1HFY23 as against a deficit of $9.1 billion during the same period last year (down 60%). For the month of Dec’22, the CAD shrunk to $400 million as against $1.9 billion in December 2021, largely on the back of shrinkage in trade deficit due to decline in imports. Remittances during the month of Dec’22 declined by 19% compared to same period last year.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

Current Account deficit, while PKR depreciated against the greenback by a staggering 15.5% during the month of January, closing the gap between interbank and open market exchange rates.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised interest rates by 100bps in the meeting held on 23rd January citing stronger than expected inflationary pressures the key reason for the hike. Moreover, as per MPC the inflationary pressures have proven to be stronger and more persistent and stressed that it is critical to anchor inflation expectations.

Inflation for the month of January clocked in at 27.6% YoY, mainly due to surge in prices of non-perishable food items and housing, electricity index.

SBP held three T-Bill auctions during the month of January, with a target of PKR1,600 billion against the maturity of PKR1,272 billion. In the first auction, an amount of PKR630 billion was accepted at a cut-off yield of 16.99% for 3-month tenure, while bids for 6-month and 12-month were rejected. In the second auction, an amount of around PKR304 billion was accepted at a cut-off yield of 16.99% and 16.83% for 3 months and 6 months’ tenures. Bids for 12 months’ bill were rejected. In the third T-Bill auction, an amount of PKR818 billion was accepted at a cut-off yield of 17.94% for 3-months tenure. Bids for 6-month and 12-month bills were rejected again.

In the PIB auction, bids for 3-years, 5-years and 10-years tenures were rejected, whereas no bids for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years were received.

As mentioned in the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), the inflationary pressures have proven to be stronger and more persistent than expected; thus MPC will carefully.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a return of 0.62% during the month of January to close at 40,673 points. The average daily volume increased by 10.5% on MoM basis as it clocked at 95.85mn compared to previous month’s level of 86.74mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$8.74mn compared to a net outflow of US$33.99mn in December, where the buying was concentrated in Commercial banks (US$3.87mn) while there was net selling in Technology and Communication amounting to US$1.57mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Commencement of talks with the IMF delegation b) MPC raised policy rate by 100bps in the meeting held on 23rd January 2023 c) Import cover now stands less than a month as forex reserves decreased to USD8.7bn by month end mainly due to external debt repayments and CAD d) PKR depreciated against the greenback by a staggering 15.5% during the month of January, closing the gap between interbank and open market exchange rates.

On a monthly basis, Fertilizer contributed the most to the index i.e. 424 points. On the contrary, Cement contributed negatively to the index the most by 233 points.

Successful quarterly review of IMF and macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR/USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term. However, valuation remains enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of ~3.9x (2023) compared to long term average of more than 8x.
