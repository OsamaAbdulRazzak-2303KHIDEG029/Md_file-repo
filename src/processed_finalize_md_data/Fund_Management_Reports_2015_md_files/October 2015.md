Fund Managers’ Report

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI for the month of October clocked in at 1.61% YoY, in line with our expectations. Headline inflation has bottomed out and rose from 1.32% to 1.61% with a monthly hike of 0.49%. The jump was propelled by a rise in perishable food items and quarterly house rent adjustment. Headline inflation over 4MFY16 has now reached 1.65% compared to 7.09% in the corresponding period last year. As opposed to CPI, Core inflation clocked in at 0.6% on monthly basis and 3.4% on yearly basis.

CPI is expected to rise in the ensuing months as the previously favorable base effect reverses. Although real interest rate of 4.4% still leaves room for another rate cut, headwinds have built up with a weaker currency and higher inflationary pressure as base effect is removed.

The current account number for Sep-15 clocked in at positive USD 309mn, with remittances up sharply by 16% MoM. 1QFY16 current account deficit numbers now stand at mere USD 0.11bn, as opposed to USD 1.63bn witnessed in the corresponding period last year. Much of this improvement is attributable to 25% improvement in the trade account during 1QFY16. While exports have slipped by 9%, imports have fallen by as much as 17% owing to lower oil import bill.

Going forward, we expect the current account deficit to largely remain subdued in the near term in line with lower oil prices. The account shall also get some support from the 2.6% Pak Rupee depreciation witnessed over FY16TD, wherein the adjustment took place predominantly to rebalance the currency in comparison to the region.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

With headline inflation clocking in at 1.32% for September, and market expectations building up for another round of monetary easing, Treasury-bill yields and bond yields inched substantially lower over the month. In anticipation of a rate cut, the market also participated heavily in T-bills and PIB auctions and pushed yields lower in the primary market. That said, FYTD Pak Rupee depreciation of 2.6% may pose some challenges to proponents of further monetary expansion.

The month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month, the market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism. Although the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month.

The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

With continuation of fiscal slippages, the demand from the government to borrow from commercial banks may inch up soon in order to bridge the budget deficit. If the SBP maintains the policy rate in its upcoming monetary policy (scheduled in November), the yield curve may shift upward from the current levels.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index bounced back sharply in October by 6.1% on the back of result season and clarity on regulatory inquiries. The market was able to breach the 34,000 level over the first half of the month, but persistent foreign selling limited further upside – with liquidity constraints visible once again over the month. Sector wise return analysis shows that Automobiles, Oil & Gas and Pharmaceuticals outperformed the index among key sectors, while Food producers saw value erosion during the month. Auto stocks rallied on the back of surprisingly positive quarterly results and persistent fall in steel prices. The Oil & Gas sector outperformed despite mixed results and no substantial change in oil prices. We attribute this to rising confidence that the worst is probably over in terms of earnings decline and that oil prices have bottomed out. Pharmaceutical companies also outperformed as quarterly results depicted substantial earnings growth.

With respect to emerging and frontier markets, key factors which have increased the concerns about market volatility are (i) uncertainty about the timing of US interest rate hike, and (ii) China’s economic slowdown. While lower oil prices have been a boon for many, a causal side effect of this phenomenon is being witnessed across global asset management companies. Compelled by rising budget deficits owing to low crude oil export receipts, key sovereign welfare funds have started to withdraw their investments from global markets to fund the deficit at home. Of those affected, half derive their capital from oil. If crude oil prices do not see an uptick, we expect foreign funds to continue facing redemption pressure, which could keep the market performance under pressure.
