Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI inflation for July-15 clocked in at a twelve year low of 1.8% YoY, compared to 3.16% for June-15 and 7.9% for July-14. While food inflation remained tamed owing to drop in perishable food items, the house rent index (HRI) witnessed a rise of 1.2% MoM. Resultantly, core inflation clocked in higher at 4.1% YoY owing to greater share of HRI.

Monthly current account deficit reduced to USD 343mn in Jun-15 versus the revised current account deficit of USD 473mn in May-15. Although trade deficit inched up 3% MoM, double digit rise in current transfers helped reduce the current account deficit. Current account deficit for FY15 stands at USD 2.3bn (↓27% YoY), as opposed to USD 3.1bn witnessed over FY14. Compared to 2% CAD (as % of GDP) in FY12, the annual numbers have shown a sequential decline in each passing year, with 0.8% CAD reported for FY15.

Amid subdued crude oil price outlook (USD 45-60/bbl range) for FY16, we expect the import bill to fall in the current fiscal year. Although 4% dip in exports is a cause of concern, we are of the view that the outgoing year reflected most of the negatives in Textile and Other export heads. Overall, we expect the current account deficit to improve further in FY16, with crude oil price acting as the key swing factor. Forex reserves are also expected to rise higher than the recent high of USD 18.7bn in consideration of multilateral and CPEC inflows.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The Central Bank maintained the policy rate at 7%, and the target rate at 6.5% in July Monetary Policy Statement. Overnight liquidity environment remained strained, owing to which SBP conducted 7 liquidity injections totaling PKR 4,200bn. In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism.

The market saw T-bill auction yields for 3M and 6M maintained at previous levels of 6.93% and 6.95% respectively, while that for the 12M T-bill came off by 1bps to 6.96%. The SBP also maintained cut-off rates for 3Y and 5Y PIBs at 8.09% and 8.99% respectively. The regulator scrapped auctions for 10Y and 20Y PIBs for the second consecutive month. Secondary market yields for both T-bills and PIBs fell over July on account of lower inflation and greater institutional demand post -June.

The policy outlook remains stable, especially in light of the 12-year low inflation of 1.8% for July. With inflation forecasted to remain benign till 1HFY16, the prospect of another potential rate cut cannot be ruled out, with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The benchmark index gained 3.9% in July, as all key sectors barring Oil & Gas sector appreciated. MCB, HBL & Engro contributed the most in terms of index points gain during July. Low inflation, status quo on discount rate and a strong rally in small cap stocks were the highlights of the month. Volumes for the KSE-100 index dipped by 8% MoM to 187mn in July.

Commercial Banks and Telecom sector outperformed amongst the key sectors, while the Oil & Gas sector lost the most value. We attribute the rise in Banking stocks to hefty foreign buying, which clocked in at positive USD 21mn in a month when overall foreign outflow was USD 21mn. On the flip side, Oil & Gas sector slipped due to 8% drop in monthly oil prices on account of US and Iran reaching an agreement on nuclear issue. The biggest net buy during the month came from local companies (USD 39mn) and Individuals (USD 31mn), with Banks/DFIs emerging as the biggest net sellers (USD 36mn).

CPI is projected to remain subdued in the next few months due to high base effect and low oil prices. Stability on the political side is also being witnessed as the key opposition party (PTI) has accepted the Judicial Commission report with focus now on electoral reforms process. With the result season in full swing, price volatility will now be limited to result announcements. That said, the market re-rating theme remains in play, where the KSE-100 index may appreciate more than modestly in the longer run, albeit with periodic corrections.
