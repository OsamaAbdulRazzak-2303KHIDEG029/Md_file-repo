Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

8MFY14 current account deficit increased to USD 2.0 billion as opposed to USD 0.8 billion during the same period last year. The main cause for this is the shortfall in CSF receipts which stood at USD 1.8 billion during 8MFY13 versus only USD 0.7 billion this year. Both exports and imports grew by 4% during the period leading to a 5% rise in trade deficit. Heavy inflows of USD 1.5 billion on account of the Pakistan Development Fund – in the form of a grant helped the PKR gain strong traction vs. the USD and led to a 6.5% appreciation in the value of the PKR during the month. We view this PKR appreciation as a positive for future levels of CPI.

CPI Inflation for the month at 8.53% YoY was slightly higher than expected with a 0.96% MoM appreciation. Core inflation further dipped in March to 7.6%. Cumulative 9MFY14 CPI numbers now stand at 8.6%, reflecting a real interest rate of 1.4%.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Due to lower than expected external flow in FY14YTD, the government’s reliance on SBP borrowing has increased. Budgetary borrowing till March 21, 2014 had reached PKR 680 billion as opposed to only PKR 139 billion in the same period last year. However, the PIB auction on March 26, 2014 saw record participation of PKR 540 billion by banks against the target of PKR 60 billion, which along with PKR 527 billion picked up in the two T-bill auctions during the month, will likely enable the quarterly SBP borrowing retirement target given by IMF to be met.

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back of unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions.

Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 posted a strong rally of 5.3% during the month to close at 27,159 points with average daily traded volume showing a slight 9% rise MoM at 153 million shares. The KSE’s net performance for the year now stands at 29.3% for the period Jul 2013 – Mar 2014. Pharmaceuticals and Auto sectors logged in the biggest outperformance while Textile stocks were the biggest underperformer in March, mainly due to PKR appreciation witnessed in the month.

The rally was driven by local buying as FIPI turned negative for the month after 5 successive months of positive numbers. Continued foreign selling in the Cement and Textile sectors led to a net outflow of USD 5.2 million during the month, despite foreigners remaining net buyers in banking stocks during the month.

| ----------------- | ----- |
| YTD:              | 7.82% |
| Month (March'14): | 8.25% |

## Fund Activity

AGCF generated a MTD return of 8.25% and YTD return of 7.82% for the period under review, comfortably outperforming its benchmark on both counts.

The fund kept its asset allocation relatively unchanged during the month with an 86% exposure to T-bills. The remainder was placed with banks / DFIs at premium rates to boost net return of the fund. The fund's cash holdings were kept to a minimum during the period in order to maximize returns by staying fully invested in higher yield instruments.

Going forward, the fund will aim to increase its duration to the maximum allowable limit of 45 days. This will allow the capture of more stable yields that have remained relatively unaffected by adverse revaluation fluctuations in shorter tenors.

## Fund Activity

During the month, IGIIF generated an MTD return of 9.61% and YTD return of 8.10%, up significantly from February's return of 7.52%. During the month, the fund increased its duration to 18.73 months by increasing its exposure in PIBs to 9.5% and in TFCs/Sukuks to 21.9%, as the recent inflation numbers and Pak Rupee appreciation increase the possibility of an interest rate cut in the next Monetary Policy Statement due in May, 2014. Going forward, we will continue to increase the duration of the fund by gradually increasing allocation to longer dated bonds.
