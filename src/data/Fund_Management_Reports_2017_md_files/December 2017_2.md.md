Fund Managers' Report December 2017

### Economic Review & Outlook

The economy continued to grow strongly during 2017 with the large scale manufacturing index up by 5.68% YoY in FY17 and up by 9.64% in 4MFY18. Growth was mostly driven by Food segment, followed by automobiles. Economic growth is expected to continue to remain strong in 2018 due to low cost of borrowing, rise in the Government’s development expenditure, and greater energy availability. GDP growth rate is expected to remain in the range of 5.0-5.5% in 2018.

The external account position worsened during the year as imports continued to climb, mostly on the back of machineries and petroleum products’ group. Continuing from the previous few years’ trend, exports declined through the first half of the year, before bottoming out. Due to the continued pressure on the balance of payments, the country’s foreign exchange reserves slipped from USD 23.2bn at the end of 2016 to USD 20.2bn towards the end of 2017. The Rupee also depreciated by 5.37% from PKR 104.825/USD at the end of 2016 to PKR 110.450/USD at the end of 2017.

Going forward, Pakistan’s external position is expected to improve. Exports are likely to continue to recover on the back of (i) PKR devaluation (ii) greater energy availability, and (iii) measures to boost exports, for example the Prime Minister’s package for textiles. Furthermore, beyond 2018 the growth rate of imports is expected to substantially decline as machinery imports are likely to normalize after this year. External position is likely to receive further support from borrowings, as during the year 2018 the Finance Ministry is expected to approach the international bond market again after a successful Sukuk and Eurobond issue of USD 2.5bn. Pakistan also has the option to borrow from bilateral lending agencies like Asian Development Bank and World Bank.

Inflation remained mostly subdued throughout 2017, and averaged only 4.09% during the year. CPI growth was slightly higher than that recorded in 2016 (3.77%) due to higher petroleum products prices and low base effect. Inflation is expected to rise slightly in 2018 due to pressures from imported inflation, low base effect and greater aggregate demand fueled by economic growth. Compared to Pakistan’s historical trend, however, inflation in CY18 is expected to be relatively subdued because of comfortable supply situation locally as well as stable international commodity prices.

Despite the approaching elections, fiscal deficit remained constrained with the deficit recorded at 5.8% of GDP in FY17 and 1.2% of GDP in 1QFY18. For FY18, the deficit is expected to rise to around 6.0% as the current Government will want to step up its expenditure ahead of General Elections in the mid of 2018. An expected increase in tax revenues due to greater customs duties and measures taken in the budget.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During CY17, market witnessed upward shift in the yield curve as evident from the graph below. During the year government’s target of meeting the budget deficit shifted heavily towards commercial banks and the central bank. During the year SBP raised PKR 12.6 trillion from T-Bills compared to a borrowing of PKR 5.2 trillion in 2016, and PKR 300 billion from PIB auctions as opposed to PKR 1.2 trillion in 2016. Government’s borrowing from T-bills as compared to PIBs shifted heavily in the latter half of CY17 and majority of the amount raised, in order to finance the government deficit, banked on the shorter tenure papers rather than the longer tenure bonds.

The market participants remained reluctant to participate heavily in the medium-long term government securities due to i) fears of a more strained fiscal position the economy would face, ii) expectations of heightened inflation compared to previous year, and, iii) expected PKR depreciation against the USD. As the concerns of rising current account deficit and perceived overvalued local currency emanated in 2HCY17, yields in the longer tenure inched upwards. The market participants remained cautious on investing in medium-long term government securities as evident during the entire 2HCY17 bond auctions. Market participants either targeted at higher yields or remained muted, therefore, the central bank refrained from giving cut-offs at higher yield and resultantly all the bond auctions of 2HCY17 got rejected.

Average inflation during CY17 stayed at approx. 4.09%. Relatively subdued inflation with positive real return inclined the MPC members to vote for status quo; however deteriorating economic conditions, abrupt currency depreciation of ~5% with the anticipation of further depreciation in the CY18 and constant increase in international oil prices may adversely impact the inflation and real return which might force the MPC members to reconsider their status quo decision going forward.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index declined by 15.3% in CY17, worst annual performance since CY08. In USD terms, the KSE-100 index was down by 19.64%, which places Pakistan Market at the very bottom of global equities according to data available on Bloomberg. Average daily turnover (ADT) during the year decreased by 22% to 102.5mn shares during CY17. However, the second half of the year saw average daily volumes shrink to only 78mn shares, a decline of 39% HoH compared to 127mn shares in 1H CY17.

There were several reasons for the rout, which include i) political uncertainty in the wake of disqualification of the Prime Minister, ii) vulnerable external account position, iii) expectations of PKR devaluation which prompted a sell-off by foreigners, and iv) introduction of several detrimental tax measures in the budget for FY18.

Politics continued to hamper market sentiment throughout the year, and the market remained jittery from April 2017 when a Joint Investigation Team was formed to probe his case, till July 2017 when the Prime Minister was actually disqualified. The political uncertainty remained high till the end of the year when the Finance Minister was finally replaced by new financial advisors.

Following Pakistan’s re-entry into MSCI’s Emerging Market Index, the foreigners chose to exit from the market due to expectations of PKR devaluation thereby causing local investors to panic. The year saw a hefty foreign portfolio investment outflow (USD 487mn), making it the worst during at least the last 10 years. Banks and Cements were the major contributors to the index’s decline.

Federal Budget FY18 also unveiled a few negatives for the stock market. The new taxation measures that dampened investor sentiment further included: (i) the levying of uniform rate of Capital Gains Tax regardless of holding period, (ii) increase in tax on dividends from direct equity holding and mutual funds, (iii) increase in minimum turnover tax from 1.00% to 1.25%, and (iv) extension of super tax for another year.

Cement Sector was the top contributor to the Index’s decline as it trimmed the Index by 2,352 points. Jitters related to upcoming capacity enhancement in the South, and resultant chances of a price war led to the sector’s decline. Sentiments were also not helped by the almost continual slide in Northern cement prices throughout the year, from PKR 543/bag in January to PKR 513/bag in December. In contrast, Southern prices remained stable through most of the year, but given the extent of capacity expansion in the region, a decline in prices in the South cannot be ruled out. Imposition of penalty on index heavyweight Habib Bank Limited (HBL) by New York State’s Department of Financial Services contributed 1,374 points (18.7%) to the overall 7,335 points decline in the KSE-100 index in CY17.

One of the biggest stories towards the end of the year, and one that will continue well into 2018, was the strategy shift in Pakistan’s thermal energy mix from furnace oil to imported liquefied natural gas. Following the doubling of the country’s capacity to import LNG, from 600mmcfd to 1.2bcfd, and the commissioning of the first units of three RLNG power plants, the power purchaser in the country shifted its electricity procurement from FO based plants to RLNG based plants. This shift led to price decline of certain oil marketing companies, refineries and independent power producers.

The top performing sectors in CY17 were Power Generation & Distribution and Steel giving a hefty return of 19.7%, respectively. Following that, heavy weight Oil & Gas Exploration sector (E&Ps) was up 3.4% and Commercial banks were down 21.4%. Lowest performing sector were textile weaving and cement with a negative return of 61.1% and 45.7%.
