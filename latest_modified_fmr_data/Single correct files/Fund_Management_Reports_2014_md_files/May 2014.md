Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Econic Review & Outlook

Inside this issue: CPI numbers for May clocked in at 8.34% YoY, showing a MoM decline, mainly due to slowdown in Food prices; Core Inflation however, continued its ascent in May by 20bps to 8.7%. For FY15, the government is expected to set a CPI target of 8.0%, which is dependent on the level of subsidy reduction (electricity & gas) and additional taxation measures announced in the federal budget. In order to keep the CPI numbers within limit, it is expected that gas tariffs will be raised for all except the domestic sector.

On the external side, April’s current account deficit number clocked in at USD55mn versus USD90mn in March, continuing to remain close to breakeven. 10MFY14 current account deficit numbers now stand at USD2.16bn as opposed to USD1.57bn witnessed in the corresponding period of last year, mainly due to lower CSF receipts. April’s trade deficit remained quite high (USD2.15bn), with exports dipping by 14% MoM and imports rising by 12% MoM. The mitigating factor for current account however will be the receipt of 4G license fee from Zong Telecom. Overall we expect reserves to remain elevated in the near term due to receipt of quarterly tranche of CSF and IMF, improved bilateral financing, privatization proceeds and launch of Sukuk bonds.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The interbank money market remained mostly tight during the month. Given the market view of a stable interest rate regime, there has been significant activity in long term bonds. The PIB auction during the month attracted sizeable participation and the government raised around PKR 240bn from the auction. 3-year PIBs witnessed the greatest participation at a cut off yield of 12.09%. The 5-year and 10-year bonds drew less response with cut off yields of 12.55% and 12.90% respectively.

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back of unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKR/USD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 showed an appreciation of 824 points (up 2.9%) during the month to close at 29,737 points, albeit with the average daily traded volume of the KSE-100 declining by a sharp 45% to 112 million shares. The market had remained virtually flat for much of the month, until a sizeable foreign inflow on May 29 boosted the KSE by 1.9%, with another 0.7% gain on May 30. Nearly a quarter of the total traded volume for the month was recorded during the last two days of the month. Foreigners continued their buying spree on the back of increased weight of KSE stocks in the MSCI FM index, with net buying of USD70mn, while other key participants remained net sellers. Individuals and Mutual Funds sold stocks worth USD31mn and USD29mn, respectively. The top three key outperforming sectors were Pharmaceuticals, Banks and Construction & Materials. Amongst the laggards, Telecom sector was the biggest underperformer.

## Fund Activity

Alfalah GHP MMF generated a MTD return of 8.36% and YTD return of 8.09% for the period under review.

The fund continued its policy of increasing its duration, which led to an increased duration of 2.50 months by month end, up from 1.91 months in April. The longer duration allows the capture of more stable yields that have remained relatively unaffected by adverse revaluation movements in the shorter tenors. The fund also reduced its cash balance to 4.8% and increased exposures in Treasury bills to 85.6% and LOPs to 9.5%.

Going forward, the fund plans to maintain higher portfolio duration and deploy available liquidity in government securities and/or bank placements based on available yield offers.

## Fund Activity

AGCF generated a MTD return of 8.31% and YTD return of 8.01% for the period under review.

The fund increased its exposure in Treasury bills to 94% during the month, at the same time increasing the duration of the fund from 34.8 days in April to 41.1 days last month, as medium term instruments have shown relative stability in yields compared to shorter tenors.

Going forward, the fund plans to maintain this strategy in order to target stability in returns while capturing higher yields. Also, the fund will look to book TDRs later in the month if June-crossing tenors offer a superior yield.

## Fund Activity

During the month, Alfalah GHP IF generated MTD return of 7.39% and YTD return of 7.96%. The fund faced adverse revaluation impact on its medium-long term portfolio during May therefore impacting the fund's returns for the month. The fund continued to prudently enhance exposure to MTS, up to 3.7% in May, in order to enhance yields. The weighted average maturity of the fund has thus declined slightly to 16.46 months. Going forward, the fund will increase duration by gradually increasing allocation to longer dated corporate and government bonds.

## Fund Activity

Alfalah GHP SF generated a MTD return of 1.93%, which allowed YTD return to increase to 23.35%.

Equity exposure was reduced to 79.8% during the month as the fund booked profits in the Oil & Gas Sector. The funds' holding in Banks were reshuffled as some new banks were added to the portfolio, while exposure was reduced in others.

Going forward, we expect stronger earnings growth in the manufacturing sector from those companies that have a high level of imported inputs as these stand to gain more from the PKR appreciation.

## Fund Activity

AGAF generated an MTD return of 1.84% and YTD return of 29.37%.

The Fund's overall exposure was maintained at approx. 86% however, sectoral exposures were shuffled to focus the portfolio on sectors with better earnings growth prospects. The main focus was kept on Banking sector which holds highest weightage in the portfolio. The higher IDR and recent investment in PIBs is expected to support NIMs. Thus, the valuations seem attractive compared to other sectors.

Going forward, we expect stronger earnings growth in the manufacturing sector from those companies that have a high level of imported inputs as these stand to gain more from the PKR appreciation.

## Fund Activity

AGVF generated an MTD return of 0.79% and a YTD return of 17.77%.

Equity exposure was slightly reduced during the month to 59.1% on the back of some profit taking in the Oil & Gas, and Personal Goods sectors where valuation appeared stretched. Exposure was increased in the Banking sector which remains one of our favored sectors due to the yield enhancement on their investment portfolios in the previous quarter.

Going forward, we expect stronger earnings growth in the manufacturing sector from those companies that have a high level of imported inputs as these stand to gain more from the PKR appreciation.

## Fund Activity

AGIF generated an MTD return of 0.46% and a YTD return of 16.40%.

During the month, the fund continued to book profits in scrips where valuations appear stretched, especially in the Oil & Gas sector, thus reducing total equity exposure further to 51.3%. On the fixed income side, the exposures were maintained in Ijara Sukuks and WAPDA Sukuk.

Going forward, the Fund will increase its equity exposure, focusing on stocks and sectors with stronger expected earnings growth, particularly those companies in the manufacturing sector that use a high level of imported inputs as these will benefit more from the PKR appreciation.

## Fund Activity

AGSOF generated a return of 8.03% in May. During the month, the fund faced unfavorable mark to market movements on its bond portfolio, which impacted returns.

With our view of interest rates having stabilized, the fund’s investment strategy is focused towards longer dated government paper, which offer a higher yield in addition to the potential for gains if interest rates ease off.

Going forward, the focus will be on trading of GoP bonds to generate yield enhancement, while maintaining the current portfolio mix.
