## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict. Extraordinarily high commodity prices and rising inflation has put fears of a global recession, however, with the shrinkage in demand witnessed all over the world, commodity prices have witnessed a freefall in the last month as most of the metals and energy commodities are now 30-40% low from their respective peaks.

Reduction in commodity prices will be a real boost for Pakistan as it is trying to reduce the Current Account deficit in order to less burden the falling FX reserves.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of June-2022 clocked at US$2.27bn relative to a deficit of US$1.6bn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$17.4bn in FY22 compared to a deficit of US$2.8bn last year. In FY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 92%YoY to USD18.7bn.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn by end of July (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR239.94/USD.

Pakistan and IMF have reached staff level agreement for ongoing 7th and 8th quarterly reviews paving way for much needed funding from IMF, Multilateral agencies and Friendly countries in the upcoming months. Moreover, increase in Energy tariffs and petroleum prices will also provide much needed discipline on the fiscal front.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of July, the Central Bank raised policy rate by 125 basis points to 15 percent quoting surging inflation and bleeding Current account deficit as main reasons.

Inflation for the month of July clocked in at 24.93% YoY, mainly due to surge in Food prices and Electricity tariffs, contributing 78% of the overall MoM change of 4.35%.

Secondary market yields for short term instruments up to 3 months increased by an average of 99bps, while yields for 3 to 12 months increased by an average of 54bps. For longer tenors, yield for 5years increased by 24bps while yield for 10 years witnessed a decline of 4bps.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions in the month of July with a target of PKR 1,150 billion compared to maturity of PKR 985 billion. In the first T-Bill auction, an amount of around PKR 479 billion was accepted, while cut-off yields stood at 15.75%, 15.80% and 15.94% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures. In the second T-Bill auction, an amount of PKR 966 billion was accepted at the same cut-off yield of 15.75%, 15.80% and 15.94% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures, respectively.

In the PIB auction, bids around Rs. 145 billion were realized for 3-years and 5-years tenures at cut-off yield of 14.00% and 13.45% whereas bids for 10-years and 15-years were rejected and no bids for 20-years and 30-years were received.

The next monetary policy is scheduled on August 22, 2022, where the market expects another hike in the policy rate as inflation is expected to remain elevated for FY23, fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a negative return of 3.35% during the month of July to close at 40,150.36 points. The average daily volume decreased by 24.2% on MoM basis as it clocked at 73.5mn compared to previous month’s level of 96.99mn as investors continued to remain shy from the Equity market due to deteriorating economic indicators including inflation, CAD and PKR/USD parity. Foreigners remained net buyers as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$7.48mn compared to a net outflow of US$12.48mn in June, where the buying was concentrated in Technology and Communication (US$6.1mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$1.64mn.

Key developments during the month include a) The Central Bank hiked policy rate by another 125bps citing rising inflation and CAD as the main reasons for the increase; b) Staff level agreement was reached between IMF and Pakistan for ongoing 7th and 8th quarterly reviews paving way for much needed funding from IMF, Multilateral agencies and Friendly countries in future; c) Due to soaring electricity and food prices, headline inflation for the month of July stood at 24.93% and d) PKR hit new low against USD of 239.94 due to continued pressure on forex reserves on account of high CAD and external debt repayments.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 62% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases increased substantially by 87% to close at 6.32k at end of the month, compared to 3.38k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Technology and Communication contributed the most to the index i.e. 235 points mainly due to USD appreciation as their revenues are pegged to USD. On the contrary, Fertilizers contributed negatively to the index the most by 461 points due to excess taxation reported in the recent quarterly results.

Macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
