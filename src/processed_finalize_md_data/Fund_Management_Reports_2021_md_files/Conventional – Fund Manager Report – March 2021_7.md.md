Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report March 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy maintained its growth trajectory throughout March. For the month of Feb’21, Current Account Deficit (CAD) clocked in at USD 50mn, down by 76% MoM and 75% YoY. Slower sequential growth in trade gap alongside a decline in outgoing primary income helped keep the deficit limited. Current account balance for the current fiscal still shows a surplus of USD 881mn (0.5% of GDP) in 8M FY21, vs. a deficit of USD 2.74bn (-1.5% of GDP) in the comparable period last year. C/A balance has received strong support from workers remittances that have averaged approximately USD 2.35bn a month in 8MFY21, 24% higher compared to last year.

Foreign exchange reserves remained largely stable and increased by ~US$ 732 mn during the month to close at US$ 20.8 bn as of 26 March, 2021. Towards the end of the month, IMF agreed to release a tranche of USD 500mn after approving four pending reviews of the country’s economic progress. The approval revived the USD6bn IMF program after it remained on hold for over a year. PKR appreciated further by 3.5% during the month of March, closing at PKR152.7586 /USD. PKR has now gained by 7.4% in 9M FY21 from PKR 168 in June 2020. Last reported Effective Exchange Rate (REER) is at 97.1 (February 2021) and it has remained under 100 now more than the last one year. We expect currency depreciation to be limited and revert to 3-4% p.a. (LT average) beyond CY21 and expect the REER to remain in the range of 95-100.

CPI clocked in at a level of 9.1% for the month of March’21 which was in line with the market consensus. Food prices were the key contributor to a higher CPI in March, increasing by 1.75% MoM. We believe inflation is susceptible to increase in coming months on back of increasing food, power and petroleum prices. Nevertheless, SBP has kept policy rate unchanged at 7 percent to continue the momentum of economic recovery and also because of consistent lower core inflation levels. Moreover, the bank has indicated that any future adjustments in policy rate will be gradual in nature.

Pakistan’s economy contracted by 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has now set a GDP Growth target of 3% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. We think the former projection will turn out to be more accurate. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July-Jan’21 taking relevant index up by 8.2% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul-Jan’2021 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

The Government led COVID19 vaccination drive that was previously only open to front-line workers and citizens over 60 years, was expanded to cover citizens aged 50 & above during the month of March. Meanwhile, COVID19 active cases began to rise again and more than doubled to 53,127 end of March, compared to only 22,098 active cases end of February. The Government also approved the sale of Russian Vaccine Sputnik V privately and it is anticipated that private hospitals will be allowed to administer the vaccine to the general public from the first week of April at a fixed price of PKR 12,200 (US$ 80) for two doses.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the reviewed month, SBP announced the monetary policy for the next two months. As expected the policy rate was maintained at 7%, the monetary policy committee (MPC) viewed that the existing stance as appropriate to support the nascent recovery, while keeping the inflation expectations well anchored and maintaining financial stability. On inflation front, the recent out turns have been volatile owing to the hike in electricity tariffs as well as rise in sugar and wheat prices. MPC termed the recent hike in commodity prices as a temporary supply side shocks and expects a medium term inflation outlook to be near 5-7% respectively.

The secondary market yields skewed upwards during the month of March. The market was of the view that the uptick in inflation could potentially lead to the discount rate reversals earlier than expectation. Hence the longer duration bonds were adjusted by around 20-30 bps. Similarly the aggressive borrowing from commercial banks pushed the short term yields upwards. The yield gap between 3, 6 & 12 months has been widened to around 25-30 bps against the historical gap of 2-5 bps.

State Bank of Pakistan conducted Treasury bill auction on 24th Mar, 2021. The auction had a total maturity of PKR 900 billion against a target of PKR 1,050 billion. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 2,042 billion. Out of total participation, bids worth, PKR 1,538 billion were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 486.20 billion in 6 months, and PKR 68 billion in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 1,486 billion in a breakup of PKR 1,111 billion, 374.4 billion, in 3 months & 6 months at a cut-off yield of 7.5398%, 7.80%, while bids in 12 months tenor were rejected.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on 4th Mar, 2021 with a total target of PKR 150 billion. Total participation of only PKR 130 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5 & 10 year tenor received bids worth PKR 42.7 billion, PKR 52.9 billion & PKR 35 billion respectively. State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 28.7 billion in 3 years, PKR 35.5 billion in 5 years, and 20 billion in 10 years at a Cut-off rate of 9.41%, 9.90%, and 10.289% respectively.

Going forward, we believe that the central bank will continue its accommodative stance on monetary policy in order to ensure the financial stability. However, the supply side shocks needs to be addressed effectively in order to control inflation. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The bourse remained lackluster during the month of March 2021 as the benchmark index KSE-100 posted a negative return of 2.78% to close at 45,865 points. The average daily turnover decreased by 11.6% on MoM basis as it clocked at 234mn compared to previous month’s level of 265mn. Foreigners remained net sellers this month as well, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$8.47mn as compared to a net outflow of US$6.18mn in February, where the selling was concentrated in Technology & Communication (US$8.1mn) and Power Generation & Distribution (US$3.89mn).

Key developments during the month included a) Daily Covid-19 cases surpassed 4k causing concerns of lockdown; b) Ratification of increase in power tariff by the Cabinet raised apprehensions for power intensive sectors; c) Delay in disbursement of first installment to IPPs due to investigation by NAB and d) Withdrawal of some income tax exemptions through ordinance. All contributed to negative sentiment in the market.

Number of daily covid-19 cases crossed 4k in last week of March compared to 1-1.5k during the month of February. The country continued to grapple with Covid-19 as infection ratio crossed 10%. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 605k compared to 546k in the last month. Further, there was an increase in total number of active cases which stood at 53.1k at month end compared to 22.1k in previous month end.

On a monthly basis, Cements contributed the most to the index i.e. 40 points, followed by Chemical sector which contributed 17 points to the index mainly due to enhancement in primary margins. On the contrary, Technology contributed negatively to the index the most by 56 points.

Macroeconomic fundamentals, Political noise, Covid-19 infections, the possible rollout of vaccines and their impact on business operations will determine market direction in the near term.
