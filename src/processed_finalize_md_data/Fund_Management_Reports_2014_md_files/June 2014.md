Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Fy14 Economics Review & Outlook

Inside this issue: FY14 closed with a mixed scorecard for the new governments first year in office. On the upside, a stronger PKR, a restarted privatisation program and healthier FX reserve position were all positives for the year. Progress still has to be made in curtailing the fiscal deficit, increasing tax collection, resolving a number of structural issues especially with relation to power and bringing down inflationary pressure.

GDP growth rebounded marginally; however in order for growth to push above a sustained 5%, the government must overcome the challenges it faces in terms of tax collection and power tariff subsidies. Undue reliance on indirect taxation has only highlighted the difficulties in widening the tax net. Continued privatisation will help support fiscal spend with the real test being the ability of the government to fund the entirety of its development spend over FY15.

The security situation warrants special merit as the commencement of Operation Zarb-i-Azb signals the first concrete step taken in finding a military solution to the growing problem of terrorism. A successful campaign will yield multiple peace dividends and improve the investment climate of the country.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back of unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions.

Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement to follow a similar trend; participation should remain skewed towards the longer tenor on the back of stable interest rates. Monetary policy will take its lead from overall CPI figures which are expected to dip marginally over the first quarter of the fiscal and then pick up again for the remainder of the year as the full impact of subsidy removals in gas and power begin to take effect.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The stock market closed with a 41% return over FY14. Volumes along with domestic and foreign participation stayed strong adding much needed liquidity to the market. The rally was considerably broad based with no one particular sector or stock contributing to the increase. This appreciation has made the KSE100 one of the best performing in the world over the period. The market responded positively to the progress made by the government on the PKR and privatisation program. An improving external account situation also helped build confidence of foreign portfolio investors.

June was an eventful month with a number of events happening on the economic front (Federal Budget), the political front (Commencement of the military operation in NWA) and the privatization front (successful SPOs of UBL and PPL held during the month). Foreign portfolio investors remained net buyers with net inflow of USD71 million over June alone. The start of the holy month of Ramazan is expected to keep interest subdued with the next trigger the commencement of the results season for the June accounts.

With a forward multiple of 8.5x and earnings growth expectation of approx 10-15%, we should continue to see positive performance by the Index over FY15.

## Fund Activity

AGAF generated an MTD return of 0.14% and a YTD return of 29.55% against a benchmark of -0.29% MTD and 41.57% YTD. The improvement in performance came in the later half of the year when the fund reshuffled its portfolio. The fund has an investment philosophy of investing in bluechips with solid performance history, however, in the current year, the market performance has mainly come from second and third tier illiquid stocks. We feel that maintaining our investment discipline is essential even though our short term performance has lagged, as equity investments are long term in nature, and over the longer term, our investment philosophy will prevail.

## Fund Activity

AGSOF generated a return of 9.11% in June. During the month, the fund faced price volatility on its bond portfolio, nevertheless, active management of the portfolio resulted in attaining a reasonable performance for the month.

With our view of a stable interest rate, the fund’s investment strategy is focused towards longer dated government papers which offer a higher yield in addition to the potential for gains if interest rates ease off.

Going forward, the focus will be on trading of GoP bonds to generate yield enhancement, while maintaining the current portfolio mix.
