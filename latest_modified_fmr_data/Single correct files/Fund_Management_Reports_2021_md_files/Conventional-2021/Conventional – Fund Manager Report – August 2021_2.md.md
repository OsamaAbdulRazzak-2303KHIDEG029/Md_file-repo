Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report August 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit (CAD) in Jul’21 reached at US$773mn compared to a surplus of US$583mn in same period last year. Higher deficit is attributable to 52% YoY increase in goods imports and slight decline in worker’s remittances of 2% YoY to US$2.7bn. Commodity wise data shows import of petroleum products witnessed a jump of 77% YoY to US$1.3bn mainly due to higher international oil prices. In addition, textile related imports were also on the higher side due to substantial reduction in previous year's cotton crop impacting current season's procurement. Imports continued the momentum in August as well and recorded highest ever monthly import number of US$6.4 bn.

Moreover, foreign exchange reserves of the country reached to historic peak level of USD27.2bn as Pakistan received US$2.75bn from IMF under new SDR allocation. Despite these inflows PKR depreciated by around 2.4% to close at 166.44 at the end of Aug’21 mainly due to concerns from external front specially the trade deficit.

Headline inflation for the month of Aug’21 stood at 8.35%. The rise in inflation was on account of higher food and petroleum product prices. In the near term, NCPI is expected to remain range bound, however, increase in international oil prices, surge in overall aggregate demand, and any power and gas tariff hikes if declared are key risks to the Government’s target inflation of 8.2% in FY22.

The Government has announced provisional GDP growth number of 3.94% for FY2021. LSM posted growth of 18% in the month of June because of low base in last year due to Covid-19. For full year FY21, LSM has depicted growth of 15% YoY. This entails a very swift V-shaped recovery in economy compared to last year.

On the fiscal front, FBR collection in 2MFY22 stands at PKR850bn against the target of PKR690bn (up 23%). Better performance was due to higher than estimated sales tax collection. We foresee the Government would likely achieve the revenue target set in FY22 budget.

Government’s vaccination drive has stepped up extraordinarily, as fully vaccinated personnel registered growth of 177% compared to last month and currently stand at 20.06mn i.e. 9% of the total population, while partially vaccinated total currently stands at 48.1mn, so a huge increase is expected in vaccinated personnel in the coming months as well. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases increased by 35%, and stood at 93.9k at the end of the month, compared to 69.7 at end of last month.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The CPI inflation stood at 8.35% for the month of August 2021.

State Bank of Pakistan conducted Treasury bill auction twice during August 2021. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 1,003.5 billion at a weighted average yield of 7.2294% and 7.4293% in 3 months and 6 months respectively. However, the bids in 12 months had been rejected.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on August 04, 2021. Total participation of PKR 444.9 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10 & 15‐year tenor received bids worth PKR 187.7 billion, PKR 122.1 billion, PKR 95 billion & 40 billion respectively. State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 67.2 billion in 3 years, PKR 33 billion in 5 years & PKR 5 billion in 10 years and 40 billion in 15 years at a cut‐off rate of 8.88%, 9.198%, 9.839% & 10.4% respectively.

Going forward, as indicated in last monetary policy statement, the policy will remain largely accommodative in the near term and a gradual adjustment will be made in order to achieve the mildly positive real rate once the economy returns to operate at its full capacity. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index posted a return of 0.77% during the month of August to close at 47,420 points. The average daily turnover declined by 14% on MoM basis as it clocked at 127mn compared to previous month’s level of 147mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$9.87mn as compared to a net outflow of US$28.6mn in July, where the selling was concentrated in Cements (US$5.01mn) while there was net buying in Technology amounting to US$9.62mn.

Key developments during the month include a) US withdrawal from Afghanistan after 20 years of war; b) PKR depreciated by 2.4% during the month, as imports for the month of August clocked at a record high level of US$6.4bn; c) CAD amounted to US$0.773bn for the month of July on the back of increase in imports due to rising commodity prices and increase in demand and d) Pakistan received US$2.7bn from IMF taking SBP FX reserves to highest ever number of US$20bn.

Number of daily covid-19 cases for the month of August averaged around 4-4.5k compared to more than 5k cases in end of July. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 1,043k compared to 942k in the last month. Further, total number of active cases increased to 93.9k at month end compared to 69.7k in previous month end.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 234 points, followed by Technology which contributed 219 points to the index mainly due to announcement of decent financial results. On the contrary, Cements contributed negatively to the index the most by 155 points.

Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and Covid-19 infections will determine market direction in the near term.

## Sindh Workers' Welfare Fund (SWWF)

During the month of August 2021, provisioning against Sindh Workers’ Welfare Fund by Alfalah GHP Cash Fund (AGCF) amounting to Rs. 24.33 million has been reversed on the clarification received by Sindh Revenue Board vide letter No. SRB/TP/70/2013/8772 dated August 12, 2021 addressed to Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan. This reversal of provision has contributed towards an unusual increase in NAV of the AGCF by 0.49%. This is one-off event and is not likely to be repeated in the future.
