Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for April 2015 clocked in at 2.1% YoY as opposed to 2.5% in the preceding month. This is the lowest monthly reading since August 2003. Although the statistic was above market-wide consensus, the evident disinflation pulled 10MFY15 inflation to 4.8% as compared to 8.7% over corresponding period last year. The monthly number was above expectations owing to price appreciation witnessed in transport, education, food and housing. The real interest rate as per the latest monthly reading now stands at 5.9%, highest since July 2003. The lower CPI and Core inflation allows us to remain optimistic about another 50bps cut in the discount rate in May 2015 monetary policy meeting.

The current account posted a positive surplus of USD 163mn in March 2015 against surplus of USD 872mn recorded in April 2015. The reduction in surplus emanated from absence of non-recurring Coalition Support Funds (CSF). Current account deficit over 9MFY15 stands at USD 1.46bn, as opposed to USD 2.69bn witnessed over last year. Upon receiving the IMF tranche and HBL privatization proceeds, the foreign exchange reserves of the country crossed the USD 17bn mark. Reserves were also supported by the aforementioned current account surplus. Going forward, reserves could even surpass USD 18bn if further multilateral financing flows in.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

With inflation hovering between 2 -3%, anticipation for further monetary easing has gained momentum and pushed yields on treasury bills and bonds lower. The lowering of the yield curve was aided by shrinkage in government’s borrowing appetite, as reflected from unusually lower acceptance of bids in T-Bill and PIB auctions conducted over April. Secondary market yields followed primary yields down to new recent lows, paving the way for a rate cut.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism. While the Central Bank is scheduled to introduce an official target rate over second half of the calendar year, the regulator that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market bounced back sharply in April by generating 11.6% for investors. This is the biggest appreciation since May 2013, and gains have more than offset the 10% decline witnessed in March 2015. The Benchmark index has now recorded a return of 13.8% on year-to-date basis.

Volumes of KSE-100 index improved by 68% MoM to 196mn, while value traded rose by a similar 69% MoM. Sector analysis shows Automobiles, Electricity and Cement sector were the key outperformers over the month. Automobiles appreciated on higher sales, while Cement sector inched higher on positive demand outlook following Chinese premier’s visit to Pakistan. Electricity sector climbed steadily as dividend yields came into focus in anticipation of further monetary easing.

International investors’ strong response to the Secondary Public Offering of Habib Bank Limited was reflective of the interest that foreigners still had in value plays. With release of the Federal Budget nearing, the market could remain sideways over May. The Budget is expected to be based primarily around tax collection measures.
