Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report June 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The final month of FY24 witnessed several significant macroeconomic events, all of which favored Pakistan. On June 10, 2024, during the MPC Meeting, the State Bank of Pakistan announced a highly anticipated 150bps cut in the policy rate to 20.5%, marking the first cut since June - 2020. This decision was pivotal for guiding the economy and influencing various stakeholders, aimed to stimulate economic growth. The substantial gap in real interest rates, facilitated by a lower year-on-year inflation due to heightened base effect and respite in food and energy prices, creating a room for rate cut.

Finance Minister Mohammad Aurangzeb presented the Federal Budget for the fiscal year 2025 on June 12, 2024, with a strong focus on achieving economic stability and growth through fiscal consolidation. Key priorities include reducing the public debt-to-GDP ratio to sustainable levels and enhancing the policy framework to rejuvenate the private sector. The budget also aims to stimulate entrepreneurship, attract investment and foster innovation. However, if revenue targets are not met, there is a possibility of needing a Mini-budget, potentially causing market uncertainty. Nevertheless, the government's commitment to reforms underscores its dedication to maintaining economic stability. This budget should act as a precursor to a new IMF program, with its successful approval aligned with IMF criteria. Combined with anticipated monetary policy easing, this could trigger rerating of stock market valuations.

In the 11 months of FY24, the current account recorded a deficit of USD 464 million, reflecting a notable improvement from USD 6,086 million in the same period last year, marking a significant 92% decrease. Specifically, May 2024 witnessed a current account deficit of USD 270 million, driven by the highest monthly import of USD 5,047 million during the 11-month period. Concurrently, remittances followed a similar trend, reaching USD 3,243 million in May 2024, the highest recorded during the 11-month period of FY24.

As of June 28, 2024, foreign reserves increased by 2.5% to USD 14,573 million, up from USD 14,216 million at the end of the previous month. Inflation for June stood at 12.6%, while the Pakistani rupee remained stable with an average exchange rate of 278 during the month.

Looking ahead, inflation is forecasted to maintain a lower trajectory, paving the way for anticipated more monetary easing in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meetings. The current real interest rate stands impressively high at 8.93%, providing a foundation for potential monetary easing stance. This could potentially lead to a reduction in the policy rate by 5%-7% over the next fiscal year. However, risks persist, particularly from potential inflationary impacts stemming from reforms outlined in the budget and IMF program, as well as volatility in exchange rates and oil prices.

Concurrently, discussions are underway for a comprehensive assistance package with the IMF. An IMF mission is scheduled to visit Pakistan in mid-July to finalize the agreement of a USD 6-8 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. The anticipated EFF program is expected to establish a structured framework for financial support from multilateral agencies, which is crucial in addressing projected external account challenges over the next three years, especially amidst substantial impending debt repayments.

On a positive note, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) platform is expected to attract significant investments from Saudi Arabia, China, and the UAE.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of June clocked in at 12.6% which increased slightly compared to May 2024. Housing, Electricity, Water, Gas & Fuels segment remained the major contributor to increase in monthly change, while majority segments remained on declining trend on MoM basis. Overall, CPI also witnessed increasing trend on MoM basis. Major increased witnessed in some food items on MoM basis such as chicken and Milk products due to price normalization after sharp fall in previous month. Overall, Year-on-Year inflation remains near 23-month low marking the instance of positive real interest rate since December 2020 and open room for SBP to cut interest rate going forward.

Recent monetary policy held at 10-June-2024 in which SBP reduced the policy rate by 150bps at 20.5%. Secondary market yield also witnessed declining trend this month and overall decreased by an average of 87bps while longer tenor yields declined by around 5bps during the month. The yields witnessed declining trend prior to monetary policy announcements as market started pricing in increase expectation of interest rate cuts due to positive indicators such as, considerable improvement in both inflation readings and external position as well as improving foreign exchange reserves.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions with a target of PKR 1,111 billion against the maturity of PKR 1,230 billion. In the first auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 1,091 billion at a cut-off yield of 20.15%, 19.97% and 18.95% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the Second auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 696 billion at a cut-off yield of 20.15%, 19.96%, and 18.54% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the PIB auction, bids worth Rs. 131 billion were accepted for 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year tenures at cut-off yields of 16.60%, 15.45%, and 14.25% respectively. However, no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years & 30-years tenures.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent elevated levels and remained at level of 12% on a consistent basis due to stability in currency along with favorable base effect. Monetary easing is expected to continue going forward potentially resulting in a reduction of 6%-8% in the policy rate over the next Fiscal year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program, volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict remain significant risk to our forecasted rate cuts this extent.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

In June 2024, KSE-100 index surged to new peaks, closing at 78,444 levels, representing a 3.38% increase on a monthly basis. The benchmark index hit an all-time high of 78,810 on June 21, 2024. It is pertinent to mention that this robust performance was experienced despite lack of populist measures in the budget for new fiscal year. Moreover, the index experienced a remarkable single-day gain of 3,410 points on June 13 2024, occurring immediately after the budget announcement. Average daily volume declined by 25% on monthly basis as it clocked at 175.7mn compared to previous month’s level of 236.41mn.

Foreign investors continued to play a significant role in market rally, where in June 2024 recorded a net inflow of US$1.83 million compared to previous month's inflow of US$15.85 million. This Investment was notably focused on the Commercial Banks, Power, and Technology sectors. Commercial Banks emerged as the top-performing sector for the month, contributing 1,516 points to the index, while the Fertilizer and Power sectors contributed 610 and 591 points respectively.

During the month, The market experienced notable upward momentum driven by several pivotal developments. Firstly, the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) decision to reduce the Policy Rate by 1.5% to 20.5% marked a substantial change in monetary policy direction, with the ongoing trend of disinflation as evidenced by a decline in CPI to 12.6% in June 2024. Moreover, robust remittance inflows supported Balance of Payments and contributed significantly to stabilizing the SBP's foreign exchange reserves. Another significant event shaping market sentiment was the approval of the Federal Budget FY25, which included amendments from its initial proposal. The budget's notable characteristics included the absence of populist measures and the introduction of higher tax measures, demonstrating the government's dedication to fiscal reforms. This development bolstered investor confidence in Pakistan's fiscal stability and its prospects for securing an IMF agreement, anticipated to be finalized in July 2024.

We believe, realization of massive investments from friendly countries and any further monetary easing can potentially spark another rally in the market. Furthermore, valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of 3.8x compared to 10 years average of 7x.
