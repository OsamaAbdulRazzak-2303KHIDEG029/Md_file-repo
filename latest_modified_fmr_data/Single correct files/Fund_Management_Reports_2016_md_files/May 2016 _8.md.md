Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report May 2016

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy grew by 4.71% in FY16, the highest rate in the past eight years. The growth was mainly driven by the industrial sector, including automobiles, fertilizers, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, rubber, and cement. Growth in the industrial and services sectors was able to compensate for agricultural sector’s poor performance. Higher government spending on development projects, greater energy availability, and low cost of production are likely to fuel the economy in the coming months.

Inflation was recorded at 3.17% in May 2016, as opposed to 4.17% in April 2016. The recent uptick in international crude oil prices is likely to ease disinflationary pressures in the coming months; however, it is unlikely that inflation will sustain a level of 4% over the remainder of this calendar year.

External position remained stable over May, with the USD trading between a narrow range of PKR 104.60 and 104.80. The country’s foreign exchange reserves reached a high of USD 21.6bn during the month, further signaling stability in the external position. Moreover, the current account posted a surplus once again in April, bringing the 10MFY16 deficit to USD 1.5bn as opposed to USD 1.8bn in the corresponding period last year. Going forward, threats to the external position stem from a rise in international crude oil prices, declining growth of remittances and overall recovery in the broader economy and therefore uptick in imports. Measures taken in Federal Budget 2016-17 to promote exports of textiles along with greater energy availability for the sector are mitigating factor that may protect the external account.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Secondary market yields slipped by 8-46 bps across all tenors during the month of May due to a surprise policy rate cut of 25bps by the Central Bank. The SBP quoted lower inflationary pressures as the reason for the cut, while at the same time highlighting growth as a weak area that required redressal.

Going forward, maintenance of status quo is expected for interest rates in the remainder of this calendar year. A rate hike, driven by expected higher crude oil prices internationally and greater commodity prices locally, is expected towards the mid of 2017. Reversal of recent gains in crude oil prices and missing of growth targets might create the chances of a further rate cut this year.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The bull-run that started in late February picked up even greater pace in May, with the result that the market gained 1,342 points (+3.9%) during the month. Excitement over the upcoming market classification review by MSCI, further strengthening of international crude oil prices, and a surprise policy rate cut by the Central Bank propelled the market. Net positive investment by foreign investors during the month of May, the first such month this year, also helped the market’s sentiments. Meanwhile, the approaching Federal Budget constrained bullish sentiment, especially expectations of a hike in Capital Gains Tax for non-filers of income tax returns.

Outperforming sectors during the month included Oil and Gas, Textiles, Engineering (steel), Telecommunication, Electricity and Chemicals. Increase in OMC margins led oil marketing companies to perform well during the month, while Pakistan Petroleum rallied on the back of extension of its Sui Gas Field license under more feasible terms. Moreover, damage to Fauji Cement’s production facility brought other northern cement players into the limelight towards the end of the month.

MSCI’s announcement on the possible reclassification of Pakistan to Emerging Market status is likely to drive equities through June and July. The local market will also take cue from the US’s Federal Open Market Committee meeting in the middle of June, in which a decision regarding rate hike is to be taken.
