Fund Managers' Report May 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia -Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On and despite meeting almost all the conditions, IMF program has remained stalled since Oct-2022. The delay in disbursement of funds/loans from friendly countries and multilateral agencies has continued to put pressure on forex reserves. SBP reserves now stand at $4.0bn, hardly covering one month of import cover based on current.

On local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3 -12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps. The Pak rupee witnessed severe depreciation of 40% in the current fiscal year.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May -2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Due to consistent low level of foreign reserves, SBP has placed stringent control on imports due to which current account deficit remained restricted at USD3.3bn. Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

CPI for the month of May reached at 37.97% with Food and Housing Index being the major contributors to the monthly change. It is expected that CPI reading to start declining in the coming months due to high base; and seemingly inflationary pressure are now over. The Government is targeting inflation of 21% in FY24 therefore there is possibility that interest rates are peaked.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account. Overall the budget would likely be contractionary. News sources suggest a new tax will be levied on the undistributed reserves of companies resultantly, many corporates have called emergency board meetings to increase authorized share capital. The government would also consider additional revenue measures to meet the fiscal targets for FY24.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of May clocked at 37.97%. Food and Restaurants & Hotels segments remained the major contributors to the monthly change. Non-perishable food prices including wheat flour continued to increase in response to increase in support prices and rising inflation. Readymade food and accommodation services also depicted a drastic increase on MoM basis. Inflation is now expected to fall in the coming months mainly because of a high base and fall in petroleum prices, albeit, at elevated levels of mid 20s till December 2023.

SBP held two Treasury Bill auctions with a target of PKR 1,125 billion against the maturity of PKR 926 billion. In the first auction, an amount of PKR 666 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.96% and 22.00% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures respectively. In the second auction, an amount of PKR 421 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.92% and 22.00% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures respectively.

In the PIB auction, bids amounting to PKR 63 billion were realized for 3-years at a cut-off yield of 19.39%, whereas bids for 5-years were rejected. No bids were received for 10 years, 15 years, 20 years and 30 years’ tenures.

Keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Central Bank in near future, so any further hike in policy rate cannot be ruled out if core inflation continues to persist at a higher level.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a negative return of 0.6% during the month of May to close at 41,331 points. The average daily volume increased by 39% on MoM basis as it clocked at 76.85mn compared to previous month’s level of 55.28mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$3.51mn compared to a net outflow of US$8.39mn in April, where the buying was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$7.78mn) while there was net selling in Food & Personal care amounting to US$3.18mn. On a monthly basis, Cements contributed the most to the index i.e. 485 points. On the contrary, Technology sector contributed negatively to the index the most by 442 points.

The index displayed a positive return of 1.6% in the first week of May as investors stayed excited by announcements of buyback and sponsor buying from index heavyweight corporates. However, the sentiments soon turned to negative due to political chaos in the country aggravated by the event on 9th May 2023. Political noise, uncertainty over the IMF program and rumors of taxation on undistributed profit in the upcoming budget continued to exert pressure on the benchmark index for bulk of the month until almost all corporates announced for capitalization of reserves by issuing bonus shares, in order to shield them from the additional tax. The market welcomed these announcements and interest was seen in companies announcing a higher increase in authorized capital.

Inflation for the month of May clocked at 37.97%. Food and Restaurants & Hotels segments remained the major contributors to the monthly change. Non-perishable food prices including wheat flour continued to increase in response to increase in support prices and rising inflation. Readymade food and accommodation services also depicted a drastic increase on MoM basis. Inflation is now expected to fall in the coming months mainly because of a high base and fall in petroleum prices, albeit, at elevated levels of mid 20s till December 2023.

The government has now implemented all the necessary reforms in order to revive the IMF program including market based exchange rate, mini budget to cover shortfall in tax revenue, reduction in subsidies, increase in utility tariffs and hike in policy rate, we believe that the talks with IMF are in conclusive phase and staff level agreement should be reached once there is clarity over the political landscape in the country along with a plan to service external debt commitments falling in the month of June and 2023.

Clarity on political front, successful review of IMF and macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR/USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term. However, valuation remains enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of ~3.6x (2023) compared to long term average of more.
