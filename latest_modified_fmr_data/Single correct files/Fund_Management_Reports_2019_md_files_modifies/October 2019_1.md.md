Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report October 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing remained subdued in 2MFY20 taking relevant index down by 6.04% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline. Recently, an important development occurred as base year for the CPI calculation was changed from 2007-08 to 2015-16. Using the new base year, Inflation for the month of Oct’19 clocked in at 11.04% whereas the inflation stood at 11.08% using the old base year due to increase in food prices, rise in utility tariffs coupled with rising petrol prices. Meanwhile, Rupee maintained its stability, appreciated slightly by 0.4% against USD through the month.

Pakistan seems to be in low GDP growth phase where FY19 GDP growth clocked in around 3.3%, but is anticipated to fall further in FY20 at 2.4%, according to IMF estimates. Fiscal position remains worrisome as large debt repayments are due in the current fiscal year. However, foreign exchange reserves increased by ~USD 86 mn during the month to close at USD15.09 bn as of 25 October 2019. Current Account deficit for the month of July'19 came in at USD 614 mn down by 14.7% YoY. Similarly, CAD stood at USD 1.55bn for 1QFY20, a massive decrease of 64% as compared to same period of last year. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Consequently, we expect further improvement in the current account. Exports during Sep’19 showed improvement and increased by 5.8% YoY. Moreover, we believe that an FTA with China can lead to a significant increase in textile exports for Pakistan going forward. Furthermore, foreign remittances were encouraging as they increased by 20.6% YoY for the outgoing month.

During last month, the SBP kept the discount rate unchanged due to lower than expected inflation numbers, signaling a peak of the monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate depending upon any inflationary shock going forward. Market activity has been depressed on the back of the CNIC condition imposed in the FY20 budget as retailers remain resistant to registering themselves. Recently, the government has postponed the implementation of this condition for three months in the face of a nationwide strike by traders. However, it may prove to be a temporary respite if the long-term issues are not resolved. Any further positive development on this front is vital to the revival of economy.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month, yields continued to decline as majority of the stakeholders are now looking at a stable economic outlook. The long term bonds remained in the limelight as the yields pushed further downward owing to the aggressive demand from the market players. The shorter end of the curve began to adjust as well due to a wide gap between the two ends.

In the latest bond auction, SBP received bids of PKR 147 bn, 120 bn, 124 bn and 500mn in 3Y, 5Y, 10Y and 20Y PIBs. Out of these bids, SBP accepted PKR 40bn/ PKR 30bn /PKR 30bn at 11.80%/ 11.60%/11.35% for 3Y/5Y/10Y respectively, however bids in 20Y PIBs were rejected. In PIB Floaters SBP accepted PKR 54.4bn out of PKR 198 bn at the cut-off 102.22.

In the last T-bill auction conducted by central bank, the total maturity was around PKR 822 billion against a target of PKR 600 billion. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 1,825 billion. Out of total participation bids worth PKR 843 billion were received in 3 months tenor, PKR 252 billion in 6 months tenor and PKR 730 billion in 12 months tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 493 billion out of which PKR 135 billion were accepted in 3months, PKR 171 billion in 6 months and PKR 186 billion in 12months at a cut-off yield of 13.2981%, 13.2999% and 12.79% respectively.

Going forward, we believe that the next few months are quite crucial for Pakistan’s economy as the government is considering several options to address the fiscal imbalance. However, the upcoming inflation numbers and monetary policy decision in November will act as a catalyst in setting out the direction of the market.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

### KSE-100 Index continued its positive momentum from the last month and posted a return of 6.62% for the month of October, closing at 34,204 points. Average daily turnover saw a massive jump of 37% on a MoM basis as it clocked at 125.4mn in October 2019 compared to previous month’s level of 91.4 mn. During October, the net foreign outflow amounted to US$ 12.93mn as compared to a net outflow of US$ 3.54mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in Cem ents (US$ 4.22mn) and Fertilizers (US$ 2.75mn) while they remained net sellers in Commercial Banks (US$ 13.54mn) and Oil & Gas Exploration (US$ 4.9mn).

Rally of the market has continued since the Central Bank declared status quo during last month's Monetary policy meeting and maintained discount rate at 13.75%. This was further strengthened by decline in long term bond yields by almost 1% MoM and improving macroeconomic fundamentals as current account deficit for 1QFY20 has fallen by 64% compared to the same period last year. Investor participation increased substantially and was reflected in the volumes at PSX which have increased significantly during the month by 37%, as investors believe that the monetary tightening is dealt with and hope that any future cut in interest rates would provide much needed impetus to the economy.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed largest to the increase of KSE -100 index with 487 points, amid very good financial results, followed by Oil and gas exploration companies with 359 points while Tobacco was the worst performing sector and dented the index by 60 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals and how quickly the SBP enters into the easing phase of the interest rate cycle will determine the market direction in the near term.
