Fund Managers' Report January 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The economy started witnessing the impact of tightened monetary policy in the second half of the year with large scale manufacturing down by 0.90% in 5MFY19. For the month of November, LSM growth was down 0.60% YoY. The positive growth in Fertilizers, Paper & board chemicals sectors was more than offset by the petroleum products, where OCAC data showed that output had decreased by 0.68% in 5MFY19 with furnace oil contributing most to the decline. In the auto sector, sales were down in most categories including tractors which went down by 24%, trucks by 27% and LCVs by 43% in the first half of FY19. The slowing growth can be seen as a direct result of higher inflation and a weakening rupee, both of which continue to contain domestic demand. SBP projects real GDP growth for FY19 at slightly above 4%.

Fiscal position continued to worsen as foreign reserves reached alarmingly low levels - overall foreign reserves went down to USD13.8bn by end of December 2018 compared to USD20.2bn at end of December 2017. The current SBP reserves constitute import cover of merely 2x. The rupee stayed stable during the month, closing at PKR138.2/USD at the end of January 2019. The worsening external account position was due to only a meager increase in exports of 0.1% in 1HFY19 with exports at USD 11.8bn. Imports went up to USD 27.4bn in 1HFY19 (1HFY18: USD 26.6bn) on the back of a 26.7% rise in petroleum imports resulting in trade deficit of USD 15.6bn for the period against USD 14.8bn in SPLY.

Friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE and China have already pledged to help Pakistan’s dwindling reserves either in form of commercial loans or delayed payments for oil. During the month, UAE confirmed its USD 6.2bn package, while China is expected to loan another USD 2.5bn to the country’s reserves. We expect these measures to contain the rupee depreciation in CY19. Going forward, we expect Pakistan-IMF talks to end soon and finalize some form of a funding package for Pakistan. However, the tightening monetary measures like i) rising inflation which SBP estimates will be between 6.5-7.5% for FY19 and ii) high interest rates will continue to limit economic growth for the year. We see exports growing in FY19 given cost competitiveness and see imports growth to be lower in FY19 compared to FY18.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, SBP raised DR by 25bps citing challenges to economy on multiple fronts, especially fiscal & current account deficit and persistently high core inflation. This hike in DR came as a surprise to the market as majority of the participants were eyeing status quo, the market sentiments were backed by the hefty participation in last PIB auction, while ministry of finance (MOF) restrained the take up amount to the target levels depicting aversion from expensive borrowings.

In the month of January, participation in T-bill auction witnessed a drop as the central bank was able to fetch only PKR 962 billion compared to PKR 2.04 trillion in Dec'18. Participation remained majorly skewed towards short term T-bills as the market makers restrained from investing in 6-Month and 12-Month T-bills. Bond auctions portrayed a completely different picture as the auction witnessed overwhelming response of PKR 286 billion compared to the target of PKR 50 billion, however the central bank restricted to its target and accepted only PKR 46 Billion. The yield on the 3 year PIB was slashed downward by 1 bps from 12.25% to 12.24%, while 5 year cut-off was maintained at 12.70% and the central bank rejected all the bids for 10 Year bonds.

Rates of National saving scheme were also increased during the period as BSC rates increased from 11.88% to 14.28%, and DSC from 10.03% to 12.47%. In order to curb constant decline in foreign reserves the government decided to tap the potential market of expats with the launch of Diaspora bonds with the target rate of 6.25% for 3 years and 6.75% for 5 years.

Going forward, a decision to enter the IMF program and a firm policy for structural reforms will set the tone for the economy.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index saw a sharp increase by 10.1% in January 2019 to close at approximately 40,800, after an 8.4% decline in December 2018. Average daily turnover decreased by 7% from December 2018 to 85.4mn shares in January CY19. The net foreign inflow, however, stood at $16.2mn for the month as compared to $28mn outflow in December 2018 as foreign investors remained net buyers in banks ($19.7bn) and fertilizers ($2.55bn).

The index maintained a bull-run throughout the month on the back of tax exemptions and reliefs doled out in the Economic Reforms Package offered by the Government. These included removal of advance tax of 0.02% on sales & purchase of shares; elimination of super-tax on non-banking companies from FY20; carry forward of capital losses for 3 years; removal of tax on intercorporate dividend; etc. Investors seemed to be indifferent from the uncertainty regarding the IMF program since loans from friendly countries (Saudi Arabia and UAE) helped prop up the reserves by $2bn to $14.8bn as at 25-Jan-19. The relatively stable PKR throughout the month helped subside investor concerns on the macro-economic front.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks led the way gaining 1,225 points, a rally which was long due backed by continued monetary tightening by the SBP as the interest rates have risen by a cumulative of 375bps in 7MFY19. Oil & Gas Exploration companies followed closely adding 939 points, with PPL and OGDC contributing 777 points collectively, on the back of the resurgence in international oil prices due to a deep political crisis in Venezuela, upbeat US jobs data, and a decrease in oil number rigs leading to a rise in West Texas Intermediate (WTI) by 14% and Arab Light by 17% MoM. The automobile sector recovered sharply due to a proposal in the mini-budget to allow non-filers to purchase cars up to 1300cc. The fertilizer sector also rallied, contributing 694 points in the index, on the back of resolution of long outstanding GIDC issue.

Going forward, talks with IMF and upcoming result season should dictate the economy and set the direction for the market.
