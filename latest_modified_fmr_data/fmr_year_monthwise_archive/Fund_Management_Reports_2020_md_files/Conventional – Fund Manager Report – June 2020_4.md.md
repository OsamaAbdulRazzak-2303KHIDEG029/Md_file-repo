## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Despite a sharp spike of coronavirus cases in June, the Federal Government did not re-impose a nationwide lockdown in order to minimize the adverse effects on the economy. Instead, the government opted for sealing selected hotspots only whereas economic activities continued in rest of the country with strict SOP’s in place.

The Federal Budget was announced on 12 June, largely maintaining status-quo of previous policies. Although no new taxes were imposed in the budget, it was notable for not providing significant incentives for various industries (apart from tariff rationalization on raw materials). Moreover, various stakeholders’ proposals regarding capital markets were ignored as well.

The Government is expecting a contraction of 0.4% in GDP for the current fiscal year as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has set a GDP Growth target of 2.1% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing remained depressed in 10MFY20 taking relevant index down by 9% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline.

Foreign exchange reserves increased by ~US$ 1,028 mn during the month to close at US$ 18bn as of June 26, 2020, mainly due to multilateral inflows. However, PKR depreciated by 3% against USD during the month. However, recent monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions should provide support to the Rupee going forward.

Current Account registered a surplus of US$ 13mn for May’20 compared to a deficit of US$ 1,004 mn in May’20. Similarly, CAD stood at US$ 3.5bn for 11MFY20, a massive decrease of 73% compared to same period last year. The external account situation had improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Exports during May ’20 showed a decrease of 55% YoY mainly due to imposition of strict lockdown to mitigate local transmission of coronavirus infections. Foreign remittances depicted decline of 19% YoY for May’20, as COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of Expatriates across the globe.

CPI clocked in at an expected level of 8.6% for the month of June’20 due to decrease in petroleum prices. In contrast, rise in food prices was witnessed. We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months due to decrease in demand and lower energy prices. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP slashed the policy rate by a further 100bps to 7 percent to restrict the economic slowdown and enable timely recovery, leading to a total cut of 625 bps in last three months.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month under review, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to reduce the policy rate by 100 basis points to 7 percent. This decision brings the cumulative reduction in the policy rate since mid-March to 625 basis points. MPC was of the view that the inflation outlook has improved further, while the domestic economic slowdown continues and downside risks to growth have increased. Against this backdrop of receding demand-side inflation risks, the priority of monetary policy shifted toward supporting growth and employment during these challenging times. It also noted that with approximately PKR 3.3 trillion worth of loans due to be repriced by early July 2020, this was an opportune moment to take action from a monetary policy transmission perspective. In this way, the benefits of interest rate reductions would be passed on in a timely manner to households and businesses.

SBP conducted T-bills auctions thrice during month in which a cumulative amount of PKR 291 billion were accepted. The cut-offs of 3M, 6M and 12M were settled at 6.85%/6.66%/ 6.85% in last auction.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 112 billion against the total participation of PKR 176 billion. The cut-off of 3year/5 year/10 year stood at 7.97%/8.44%/8.99% respectively.

On islamic front, SBP conducted GOP Ijarah sukuk auction. Like previous auction, market witnessed a heavy participation in this auction as well. Against the total target of PKR 75 billion, a total of PKR 115 billion worth of participation was made in this auction. SBP accepted PKR 47bn at the rate of (6month Weighted Average T-bill rate minus 10 bps).

As the inflation for the month of May has settled down to 8.59%, the surge inflation is mainly attributed to surge in food inflation. We believe any supply side shock specifically in agricultural output due to locust crisis in the region will surely add fuel to the fire of an economic disruption going forward. Owing to these developments, the long term bonds yields have adjusted at 7.53%/8.11%/8.69% for 3y/5y/10y respectively while short term T-bills have adjusted at 7.09%/7.05%/7.05% for 3m/6m/12m respectively.

We will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to capitalize gains in coming months.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index registered a return of 1.45% in the month of June 2020 to close at 34,421 points. The average daily turnover saw a decline of 15% on MoM basis as it clocked at 114.9mn in June, compared to previous month’s level of 135.4mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during June'2020 amounted to US$45.7mn as compared to a net outflow of US$39.9mn in May’2020. Foreign investors remained net sellers in all major sectors, led by Commercial Banks (US$ 15.4mn) and Fertilizers (US$ 8.4mn).

Before the budget announcement, KSE 100 index rallied 3.53% during the first 9 trading sessions of the month on the anticipation of a business friendly budget. The Government unveiled the federal budget for FY 2020-21 on 12th June 2020, wherein several benefits were announced to reduce the cost of doing business as duties in a number of raw materials and finished products were either eliminated or decreased. But broadly, the budget failed to satisfy industry demands and gain any major attention from investors’ point of view as no relief measures were provided for the PSX, hence the bourse lost 4% post budget announcement till the date of an interest rate cut. On 25th June 2020, the Central Bank called an emergency monetary policy meeting where a further cut of 100bps in policy rate was announced as outlook for inflation has further improved and also to spur economic activity and support growth and employment to contain the negative impacts of the pandemic. This decision was welcomed by the bourse as the KSE-100 index posted a positive return of 2.1% in the last 3 trading sessions of the month.

Covid-19 cases continued to rise during the month of June as we witnessed daily cases to cross the 6.5k level but it has been on a declining trend since June 19, 2020, as daily cases nowadays are close to 4k. On an overall basis, we finished the month with 213k & 108k confirmed and active cases respectively.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed largest to the upside of KSE-100 index with 421 points majorly because of attractive valuations, followed by Pharmaceuticals with 97 points as healthcare has become primary focus of every individual since the outspread of Covid-19 and also because of marketing of breakthrough drugs against Covid-19 in Pakistan. On the contrary, Power generation and distribution contributed negatively to the index the most by 150 points, followed by Oil & Gas Exploration with 88 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals and resumption of normal business activities will determine market direction in the near term.
