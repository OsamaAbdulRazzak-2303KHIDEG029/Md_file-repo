## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account deficit for the month of Feb 2022 stood at US$575mn compared to a deficit of US$54mn in same period last year due to higher imports and decline in worker’s remittances. Cumulatively, current account deficit reached to US$12.1bn in 8MFY22 versus a surplus of US$0.99bn last year mainly attributed to bull-run in the commodity cycle and improvement in economic activity. Oil prices have surged to USD114 per bbl, the highest level since 2014 on account of deepening Russia-Ukraine crisis. In addition, prices of other commodities including natural gas, coal and wheat witnessed northward movement following the Russian attack on Ukraine.

Nevertheless, in an unexpected move, Prime Minister of Pakistan announced relief to the masses by reducing Petrol and HSD prices by PKR10 per liter along with reduction in electricity tariffs. The relief measures will last till the upcoming budget. To some extent, these steps would curtail inflation but on the flip side its economic repercussion would reflect in budgetary and external account deficits.

CPI for the month of March clocked in at 12.72%, wherein perishable food items increased by 30% YoY mainly due to increase in Chicken prices by 34% along with Vegetables and Fruits. We expect inflation would continue to remain on the higher side amid rising commodity prices.

Large Scale Manufacturing Index growth during Jul-Jan’22 stood at 7.6% over July-Jan’21. During Jan’22, production of Food and Textile witnessed an increase of 16.6% YoY and 5% YoY respectively.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for the month of March clocked in at 12.7% YoY in Mar’22, mainly due to increase in non-perishable food items, contributing 2.66% in the overall MoM change of 0.79%. On the flip side, the housing index fell by 2.25% MoM mainly due to a reduction in electricity charges.

Secondary market yields increased across all tenors as 3m, 6m and 1year rates increased by 130bps, 146bps and 150bps respectively. Yield for 3years and 5years also increased by 121bps and 106bps respectively.

In the last T-bill auction held on 22nd Mar, 2022, the auction had a total maturity of PKR 793bn against a target of PKR 800bn. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 893bn. Out of total participation bids worth, PKR 308bn were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 291bn in 6 months, and PKR 294bn in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 215bn in 3 months’, PKR 214bn in 6 months’ and PKR 169bn in 12 months’ at a cut-off yield of 11.99%, 12.50%, and 12.70%, respectively.

Auction for Fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on March 16th, 2022 with a total target of PKR 100bn. The SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 54bn in 3 years, PKR 80bn in 05 years & PKR 59bn in 10 years at cut off rates of 11.85%, 11.75% and 11.74% respectively.

The next monetary policy is scheduled on April 19, 2022, where the market expects a decent hike in policy rate. Inflation is expected to remain in 12-14% band for next 7 months as food prices are likely to remain high in Ramadan, moreover, imported inflation and exchange rate depreciation is expected to keep prices upwards.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index displayed a return of 1.05% during the month of March to close at 44,928.83 points. The average daily volume decreased by 14.3% on MoM basis as it clocked at 83.12mn compared to previous month’s level of 96.98mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$24.57mn compared to a net outflow of US$15.03mn in February, where the buying was concentrated in Technology and Communication (US$3.01mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$26.29mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Opposition filed a no confidence motion against Prime Minister on March 8, 2022 citing inflation and poor governance as key reasons for this move, stimulating political instability and uncertainty; b) CPI for the month of March clocked in at 12.72%, wherein perishable food items increased by 30% YoY mainly due to increase in Chicken prices by 34% along with Vegetables and Fruits; c) At month end, PKR closed at all-time low of 183.5 against USD due to continued pressure on forex reserves on account of high CAD and external repayments and d) Commodity prices including Steel and Wheat continued to rise with fresh sanctions on Russia.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 60% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases fell substantially by 77% to close at 8.69k at end of the month, compared to 37.09k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Technology and Communication contributed the most to the index i.e. 330 points. On the contrary, Commercial Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 163 points.

Resolution of the recent Political crisis, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
