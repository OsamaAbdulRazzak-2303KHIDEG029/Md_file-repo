## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

LSM Data released in October continued to show strong production growth in the country, up by 11.3% YoY in the Jul-Aug period. Biggest contributors to the growth were Automobiles, Non Metallic Mineral Products and Food and Beverages. Going forward GDP growth is expected to remain strong on the back of higher energy availability, continued public sector expenditure on CPEC and PSDP projects, and low cost of borrowing. Most monetary and credit agencies expect the country’s GDP growth rate in FY18 to be above 5%, with SBP forecasting it to be in the range of 5-6%, and IMF expecting it to average at 5.57%. Moreover, S&P anticipates growth to average 5.7% in the period 2017-2020. Meanwhile, the high GDP growth has continued to create pressure on the external sector, leading to a rise in imports of goods by 25% in 1QFY18, which in turn has led to a rise in current account deficit (CAD) to USD 3.6b (CAD/GDP: 4.2%), up by 2.25x from the corresponding period last year. According to data released by SBP, the rise in imports was mostly driven by Oil and Petroleum products, Iron and Steel, and Machinery and Mechanical Appliances. Due to the worsening trade balance, stagnant remittances and repayments of foreign loan, foreign exchange reserves continued to decline in the first four months of FY18, reaching USD 19.9b towards the end of October. As usual, the USD/PKR exchange rate remained stable, and is expected to remain constant till the end of the tenure of this Government next year. Due to the impact of an uptick in international crude oil prices and upward revision in house rent index, inflation was up by 0.7% MoM during the month. CPI was recorded at 3.8% YoY in October, compared to an average of 3.39% in 1QFY18 and 4.58% in 4QFY17. Inflation is expected to remain at a somewhat elevated level for the rest of the fiscal year due to higher international oil and coal prices, demand pressures due to economic growth and greater fiscal stimulus due to the planned expenditure ahead of general elections next year. SBP is expecting inflation to remain in the range of 4.5-5.5% during the year, while IMF expects inflation to average at around 4.8.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of Oct-17, money market remained largely range bound owing to frequent injections from the central bank. SBP conducted T-bill auction twice during the month with a cumulative target of PKR 1.3 trillion, while maturity stood at PKR 1.4 trillion. Market participation was largely skewed towards 3 months tenor, while 6months & 12 tenor witnessed a negligible participation. In PIB auction, the total target was around PKR 50bn however, due to limited market participation at scattered levels the SBP refrained from giving a cut off level and rejected all bids. Going forward, market is expected to remain range bound in the shorter tenure owing to stable interest rate scenario, however long term yields may witness an uptick owing to the surge in international oil prices and uncertain macroeconomic situation.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After posting a slight recovery in September, the KSE-100 Index slipped again in October to post a negative return of 6.6%. The decline brought the return of 4M FY18 to a negative 15%. As has been the case since the rout began in May, politics played a pivotal role in dampening sentiments as the ex-Prime Minister was indicted by the anti-corruption court, leaving the ruling political party as well as the general political environment of the country in a state of uncertainty. Sentiments were further worsened by a return to foreign portfolio investment outflow during the month (negative USD 9m), versus an inflow during September (USD 28m). Moreover, a less than exciting earnings season could not salvage the market, as a number of results disappointed investors, especially those of PAEL, ASTL and NCL. On the other hand, investors were pleasantly surprised by results of PSMC, EFOODS, GTYR and NBP. Furthermore, SNGP surprised investors by not only posting EPS of PKR 13.58 for FY17, but by also announcing an annual dividend after a lapse of 5 years, of PKR 6/share and a further PKR 1.5/sh with the 1Q FY18 results. The Index was further buoyed by Oil and Gas stocks, especially PPL and POL, both of which were the top gainers in the KSE-100 Index by index points. The rally in E&P stocks was mostly attributable to the surge in International Crude Oil prices following separate statements by the Saudi Prince and Oil Minister that indicated that Saudi Arabia will be looking to extend the current oil production agreement beyond March 2018. Going forward the market is expected to trade within a narrow range until the tenure of the current Government ends in the first half of 2018, and till the PKR depreciates.
