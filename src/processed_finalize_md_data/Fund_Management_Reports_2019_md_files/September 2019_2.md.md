Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report September 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing remained subdued in July’19 taking relevant index down by 3.28% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals and iron and steel products leading the decline. An important development occurred as base year for the CPI calculation was changed from 2007-08 to 2015-16. Using the new base year, Inflation for the month of Sep’19 clocked in at 11.4% whereas the inflation stood at 12.6% using the old base year due to rise in utility tariffs coupled with rising petrol prices. Rupee appreciated slightly by 0.3% against USD through the month.

Pakistan seems to be in low GDP growth phase where FY19 GDP growth clocked in around 3.3%, but will fall further in FY20 at 2.4%, according to IMF estimates. Fiscal position remained worrisome as foreign exchange reserves decreased by ~USD 615.8 mn during the month to close at USD15 bn as of 27 September 2019 due to import payments. However, the reserves are expected to increase going forward as lending from other development institutions follow the IMF bailout. Current Account deficit for the month of July'19 came in at USD 614 mn down by 14.7% YoY. Similarly, CAD stood at USD 1.29 bn for 2MFY20, a massive decrease of 54.7% as compared to same period of last year. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Consequently, we expect further improvement in the current account. Exports during Aug’19 showed improvement and increased by 1.4% YoY. Moreover, we believe that an FTA with China can lead to a significant increase in textile exports for Pakistan going forward. Furthermore, foreign remittances depicted a decrease of 19.1% YoY for the outgoing month.

During last month, the SBP kept the discount rate unchanged due to the lower than expected inflation number for August, signaling a peak of the monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate dependent upon any inflationary shock going forward. Market activity seems to be depressed on the back of the CNIC condition imposed in the FY20 budget as retailers remain resistant to registering themselves. Any further positive development on this front is vital to the revival of economy.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, yield curve shifted downwards owing to the expectation of a rate cut by the market participants as the yield on longer tenure shifted by ~84bps on average. However, the central bank left discount rate unchanged at 13.75% citing that the action was appropriate to bring inflation down to the target range of 5% - 7% in the next 24 months.

Inversion in yield curve deepened as the central bank accepted only PKR 183 billion in fixed rate bonds (PIB) compared to the total participation of PKR 787 billion. Cutoffs for 3Y, 5Y and 10Y stood at 12.95%, 12.50% and 12.24% respectively.

Participation in T-bill auctions during September ‘19 stood at PKR 973 trillion compared to PKR 1.9 trillion in the month of August ’19. Majority of the participation during the auctions was witnessed in 12-month T-bills. Cutoffs of 3M, 6M and 12M T-bill stood at 13.73%, 13.84% and 13.85% respectively.

The month of September ’19 witnessed a total flow of USD 242 million under SCRA bringing the total FYTD inflows to USD 328 million indicating interest of foreign investors in country’s debt instruments on the back of stable currency and double digit interest rates. So far, the flows have been witnessed in T-bills where rates are attractive compared to longer tenure.

Going forward, we expect the yield curve to remain inverted in the short term, as we believe that the interest rates might remain at current levels, with easing cycle not starting any time soon.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

### KSE-100 Index posted a positive return of 8.11% for the month of September after seven consecutive negative monthly returns, closing at 32,079 points. Average daily turnover in September 2019 came in at 91.4mn which was 9% higher than previous month’s level of 84.1 mn. During September, the net foreign outflow amounted to US$ 3.54 as compared to a net outflow of US$ 3.52mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in fertilizers (US$ 2.72mn) and Oil & Gas Exploration (US $0.54mn) while they remained net sellers in Commercial Banks (US$ 2.65mn) and Cements (US$ 2.01mn).

Investors' confidence boosted as Central Bank declared status quo during this month's Monetary policy meeting and maintained discount rate at 13.75%. The decision was taken keeping in view the actual and forecasted inflation numbers and the vast improvement in current account numbers as CAD fallen by a massive 55% during 2MFY20. Volume during the month increased by 9% as investors hoped that the monetary tightening is dealt with and there might be a revival in economy if interest rates are decreased in the upcoming Monetary policy meetings.

On a monthly basis, Oil and gas exploration companies contributed largest to the increase with 804 points, amid attractive valuation and good results, followed by Commercial banks with 421 points. Automobiles and Cements were the worst performers and dented the index by 24 and 11 points respectively.
