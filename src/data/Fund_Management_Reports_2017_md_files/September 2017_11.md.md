## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The external account remains under distress with the current account deficit doubling to USD2.6bn in 2MFY18 vs. US1.3bn in the same period last year. The deficit as a percentage of GDP has risen to 4.6% in 2MFY18 visa-vis 2.5% in same period last year. On the flip side MoM analysis reveals that the current account deficit has improved relatively in Aug’17 amounting to USD550mn a decrease of 73%MoM from USD2.1bn in Jul’17. This improvement has been supported by rising workers remittances (27%MoM) and falling trade deficit (-25%MoM). According to the summary of trade statistics published by SBP, Aug’17 exports have shown some improvement by +14%YoY and imports have slowed down rising by only 9%YoY.

Remittances have broken their declining trend and increased by 27%MoM/13.18%YoY in Aug’17 to stand at USD1.9bn vs. USD1.5bn in Jul’17 primarily due to proceeds received for Eid festivities. However, oil price woes could continue to hit remittances as economic conditions in the Gulf region remain uncertain. FDI continues to gather momentum and posted a hefty growth of 148%YoY to reach USD234.5mn in Aug’17 vs. USD94.6mn in the comparable period last year. Numerous positive macroeconomic conditions including improved law and order situation, better energy availability, historically low cost of borrowing (5.75%) and development spree across the country have led to conducive business environment.

State Bank in its latest monetary policy (29th Sep 2017) announcement has decided to maintain the policy rate at 5.75%. Inflationary pressure is expected to remain subdued due to adequate food supplies and stable commodity prices. SBP acknowledges the challenges on the external front however, aims to provide monetary stimulus to the economy and export sector in the form of stable and easing monetary policy stance. Consumer Price Index for Sep’17 has increased by 3.86%YoY as compared to 3.4%YoY in Aug’17 and 3.9%YoY in Sep’16 chiefly due to surge in food prices. However, average inflation for 3MFY18 has decreased to 3.4%YoY vs. 3.9%YoY in same period last year. On the external front, oil prices have started to test their resistance levels despite OPEC nations’ efforts to curb output and could exert inflationary pressure nevertheless maintaining full year inflation under target.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the reviewed month, yield curve witnessed an uptick owing to concerns over current account deficit and rising oil prices. Yields in the longer duration instruments adjusted sharply with 5Y shifted up by 21bps. During the period, SBP conducted two T-bill auctions with a cumulative target of 1.5 trillion, market participants maintained their stance of investing in lower duration and mostly maintained their exposure in 3M T-bill followed by 6M T-bill with a lower to negligible participation witnessed in 12M T-bill, cutoffs of both the auctions were maintained at 5.99%, 6.01% and 6.02%. In the PIB auction, market participant’s view was reinforced as the total participation equaled to a meager of PKR 6 billion out of which 3Y received majority of bids of PKR 2.8 billion. The negligible participation by the participants resulted in auction being rejected.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After closing three consecutive months in red, KSE100 index regained 2.9% in Sept-17. The performance in 1QFY18 however, remained lackluster with -9% change as investor sentiment remains shrouded by political and economic uncertainties. Average trading volumes of KSE-100 index declined by 18%MoM in Sep’17 and stood at 76mn shares vs 92mn shares in Aug’17. On a positive note, net foreign inflows were positive at USD30mn with inclusion of 5 scrips on FTSE Global Indices and upgradation of Pakistan to EM status in S&P Dow Jones. Pharma, Food producers and Telecom sector stood out as top performers in Sept-17, outperforming the KSE-100 index by 7.8%, 6.6%, 4.6% respectively. While Multi-utilities, Cements and Software were major laggards trailing KSE-100 index by 10.7%, 9.5%, 8.4% respectively. Pharma sector’s exuberance was due to DRAP’s improved efforts to raise pharmaceutical product prices. Food sector also witnessed a positive return of 9.5%MoM. Construction and material sector took a hit of -6.6%MoM due to lower cement prices and rising coal prices in the international market, which a major cost driver for the sector.
