Fund Managers' Report November 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. Most of the world economies are currently struggling to cope with multiyear high inflation and interest rates. Domestic inflation is still suffering from adjustments in local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on utility tariffs and depreciation of the rupee which have continued to exert upward pressure on domestic prices and the recent floods which have caused huge supply chain issues destroying crops, human, physical, and livestock capital and has deprived many families of their assets and income. As a result, SBP expects GDP growth for the year to be around 2%.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Moreover, in a surprise move, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised interest rates by 100bps in the meeting held on 25th November citing stronger than expected inflationary pressures the key reason for the hike. Moreover, as per MPC the hike is aimed at ensuring that the elevated inflation does not become entrenched and risks to financial stability are contained.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

The Current Account posted a deficit of $2.82 billion for 4MFY23 against a deficit of $5.31 billion during the same period last year (down 47%). For the month of Oct’22, the CAD shrunk to $567 million as against $1.78 billion in Oct’21 (down 68%), largely on the back of shrinkage in trade deficit due to decline in imports. The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program.

Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

Furthermore, on 29th November, the country received $500mn from AIIB as co-financing to the BRACE development program which aims to support the government’s efforts to deal with the adverse impacts of devastating floods. As a result, foreign exchange reserves are expected to increase at November end compared to the last reported level of USD13.378bn on 25th November 2022 while PKR depreciated against the greenback and closed the month at 223.95 from 220.89 at the end of October.

Subsequent to the month end on 2nd December, the country made $1bn bond payment to its international lenders thus ending the risk of a near term default. However, there are concerns over the country’s ability to repay its long term debts falling due in the next three years.

Reduction in energy and major commodity prices as a result of falling global demand due to recession could potentially be a real boost for Pakistan, which can ultimately result in reduction in inflation, the import bill and consequently Current Account deficit. Moreover, this will provide a much needed respite to FX reserves.

IMF’s next review was scheduled in November, however, it has been slightly delayed as the international lender remained concerned over country’s flood related financial requirements and declining revenue measures because of curb in imports. The Government is trying to negotiate with the IMF, Multilaterals, and friendly countries for aid and to postpone or rollover any debt repayments falling due in the near future.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the last monetary policy decision held on November 25, 2022, MPC raised the policy rate by 100bps citing stronger than expected inflationary pressures the key reason for the hike. Moreover, as per MPC the hike is aimed at ensuring that the elevated inflation does not become entrenched and risks to financial stability are contained.

As a result, secondary market yields for short term instruments up to 12 months increased by an average of 107bps. For longer tenors, yield for 3, 5 and 10 years increased by 101bps, 82bps and 6bps respectively. Inflation for the month of November clocked in at 23.84% YoY, mainly due to surge in food prices because of widespread floods that have devastated crops and farmlands and the increase in electricity tariffs.

SBP conducted the Treasury bill auction on 30 November 2022. The auction had a total maturity of PKR 855bn against a target of PKR 850bn. Bids worth PKR 198bn in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 5bn in 6 months’ tenors & PKR 2bn in 12 months’ tenor were accepted at a cut-off yield of 16.99%, 16.80% & 16.84% respectively.

In the PIB auction, bids around PKR27 billion were realized for 5-years tenure only at a cut-off yield of 13.35%. Bids in 3-years and 10-years tenure were rejected, whereas no bids for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years were received.

As mentioned in the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), the inflationary pressures have proven to be stronger and more persistent than expected and MPC will carefully monitor short term prospects for inflation, so another hike in interest rates in future cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a return of 2.63% during the month of November to close at 42,348.63 points. The average daily volume decreased by 13.67% on MoM basis as it clocked at 82.7mn compared to previous month’s level of 95.8mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$2.00mn compared to a net inflow of US$14.37mn in October, where the buying was concentrated in Commercial banks (US$5.75mn) while there was net selling in Technology and Communication amounting to US$1.32mn.

Key developments during the month include a) the country received $500mn from AIIB as co-financing to the BRACE development program which aims to support the government’s efforts to deal with the adverse impacts of devastating floods; b) the Central Bank raised interest rates by 100 bps in the meeting held on 25th November citing stronger than expected inflationary pressures the key reason for the hike; c) inflation for the month of November clocked at 23.8% compared to 26.6% in October. The monthly ease in inflation was mainly on the back of downward revision in perishable food prices and d) IMF’s next review was scheduled in November, however, it has been slightly delayed as the international lender remained concerned over country’s flood related financial requirements and declining revenue measures because of curb in imports.

On a monthly basis, Technology & Communication contributed the most to the index i.e. 332.61 points. On the contrary, Miscellaneous contributed negatively to the index the most by 10.12 points.

Successful quarterly review of IMF and macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR/USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term. However, valuation remains enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of ~4.1x (2023) compared to Asia Pac regional average of 12.9x.
