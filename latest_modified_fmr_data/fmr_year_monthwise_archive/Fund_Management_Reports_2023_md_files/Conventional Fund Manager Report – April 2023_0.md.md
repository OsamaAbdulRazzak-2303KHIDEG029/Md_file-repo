Fund Managers' Report April 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On from the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

On a positive note, Current account posted surplus of $654mn during Mar’23 (surplus after almost 2.5 years) due to restriction on non-essential imports, resultantly in 9MFY23 the current account deficit controlled at $3.4bn significantly below than the IMF estimates of $8bn for FY23.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of April clocked at 36.42%. Food and Clothing & footwear segments remained the major contributors to the monthly change. Non-perishable food prices including wheat flour and sugar continued to increase in response to increase in support prices and rising inflation. Inflation is expected to be elevated in the coming months due to PKR devaluation and adjustment in utility tariffs before falling sharply from June onwards because of a high base.

In Monetary policy meeting held on April 04, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 100 basis points to 21%, citing expectations of high inflation in near future. However, the MPC highlighted that there are indications of inflation peaking close to current levels and barring any unexpected shocks, the policy rate of 21% has maintained the real interest rate in positive territory on a forward-looking basis.

SBP held two Treasury Bill auctions with a target of PKR 1,900 billion against the maturity of PKR 1,875 billion. In the first auction, an amount of PKR 2,140 billion was accepted at a cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.98% and 21.89% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures respectively. In the second auction, an amount of PKR 561 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.98% and 21.99% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures respectively.

In the PIB auction, bids amounting to PKR 144 billion were realized for 3-years at a cut-off yield of 18.39%, whereas bids for 5-years and 10-years tenures were rejected. No bids were received for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years tenures.

Keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Central Bank in near future, so any further hike in policy rate cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a positive return of 3.95% during the month of April to close at 41,581 points. The average daily volume decreased by 20.4% on MoM basis as it clocked at 55.28mn compared to previous month’s level of 81.24mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$8.39mn compared to a net outflow of US$6.72mn in March, where the buying was concentrated in E&Ps (US$4.06mn) while there was net selling in Food & Personal care amounting to US$0.33mn. On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 451 points. On the contrary, Insurance sector contributed negatively to the index the most by 20 points.

The index remained largely flat in first 8 trading sessions of the month, posting a meagre return of 0.31% as investors remained cautious on taking fresh exposure in the market because of a) higher than expected inflation number for the month of March, an expectation of a higher increase in policy rate in the Monetary policy meeting and uncertainties over the political landscape and the IMF program. However, the overall sentiment changed after receiving fresh commitments for support from Saudi Arabia and UAE amounting to $2bn and $1bn respectively. Moreover, outstanding results posted by index heavy weights including Banks, Oil & Gas exploration companies and Cements played a great role in uplifting the mood of market participants. Furthermore, a director in IMF, quoted in the recent spring meetings that IMF is working very closely with Pakistan in resolving its issues and a Staff Level Agreement will be reached very soon.

Inflation for the month of April clocked at 36.42%. Food and Clothing & footwear segments stood as the major contributors to the monthly change. On April 04, 2023, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 100 basis points to 21%, however, the MPC highlighted that there are indications of inflation peaking close to current levels and barring any unexpected shocks, the policy rate of 21% has maintained the real interest rate in positive territory on a forward-looking basis.

The government has now implemented all the necessary reforms in order to revive the IMF program including market based exchange rate, mini budget to cover shortfall in tax revenue, reduction in subsidies, increase in utility tariffs and hike in policy rate, we believe that the talks with IMF are in conclusive phase and staff level agreement should be reached once there is clarity over the political landscape in the country along with a plan to service external debt commitments falling in the months of May and June.

Clarity on political front, successful review of IMF and macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR/USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the coming months.
