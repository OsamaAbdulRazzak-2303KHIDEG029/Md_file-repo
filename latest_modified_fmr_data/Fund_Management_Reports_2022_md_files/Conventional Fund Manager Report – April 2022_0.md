## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit for the month of Mar-2022 clocked at US$1,028mn relative to a deficit of US$369mn in same period last year, mainly due to an increase in imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit reached at US$13.17bn in 9MFY22 versus a deficit of US$0.275bn last year on account of bull-run in the commodity prices and improvement in overall economic activity. The war between Russia and Ukraine is continuously affecting the global economy. Russian invasion of Ukraine impacted the global supply chain and trade across the globe. Consequently, commodity prices witnessed strong surge as oil prices are hovering around US$112/bbl (highest level since 2012). Along with this, other non-energy prices are also at their respective historic highs.

On account of higher than expected inflation levels and to control the current account deficit and bleeding FX reserves, SBP decided to increase the policy rate by 250 basis points to 12.25%. Further, foreign exchange reserves declined to US$16.5bn in Apr’22 versus US$17.4bn in Mar’22. The worsening position on external front kept the PKR rupee under pressure and hit an all-time high level of PKR185.69 against USD in Apr’22.

Despite the unchanged petroleum product prices, inflation registered at 13.37% due to high prices of essential food items in the month of Ramadan. The newly formed government are continuing with the same petroleum product’s prices at the cost of higher fiscal deficit. Inflation is expected to increase further as government will ultimately decide to pass on the higher fuel price to consumers in order to curtail the fiscal loss and resume the stalled IMF program. We expect, inflation to remain on higher side on account of PKR depreciation and removal of subsidies.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of April clocked in at 13.37% YoY, mainly due to increase in perishable food items, contributing 0.90% in the overall MoM change of 1.60%. On the flip side, the housing index fell by 0.16% on MoM basis mainly due to a reduction in electricity charges.

Secondary market yields increased across all tenors as market expects further hike in interest rates in future, despite a hike of 250bps in emergent Monetary Policy meeting held on April 06, 2022. 3m, 6m and 1year rates increased by 265bps, 236bps and 213bps respectively. Yield for 3years and 5years also increased by 112bps and 65bps respectively.

During the month of April 2022, SBP conducted three T-Bill auctions with a target of PKR1,700 billion against the maturity of PKR1,558 billion. In the first T-Bill auction, bids worth PKR644 billion were accepted at cut-off yields of 12.80%, 13.25% and 13.30% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures. In the second T-Bill auction, bids worth PKR579 billion were accepted at cut-off yields of 13.50% and 13.85% for 3-month and 6-month & 12-month tenures. In the third T-Bill auction, bids worth PKR629 billion were accepted at cut-off yields of 14.79%, 14.99% and 14.81% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures.

In the PIB auction, bids worth PKR387 billion were realized for 3-years, 5-years and 10-years tenures at cut-off yields of 13.30%, 12.95% and 13.15% whereas no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years.

The next monetary policy is scheduled on May 23, 2022, where the market expects a hike in policy rate in the range of 50-100bps as inflation is expected to remain in 13-15% band for next 6-7 months as subsidy on petroleum products is expected to be removed. Moreover, imported inflation due to high commodity prices and PKR depreciation is also expected to keep product prices upwards.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index showed a return of 0.71% during the month of April to close at 45,249.41 points. The average daily volume increased by 46.2% on MoM basis as it clocked at 121.54mn compared to previous month’s level of 83.12mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$5.07mn compared to a net outflow of US$24.57mn in March, where the buying was concentrated in Technology and Communication (US$6.62mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$15.77mn.

Key developments during the month include a) PM Imran Khan was ousted as Prime Minister of Pakistan by a successful no-confidence move by the opposition; b) CPI for the month of April clocked in at 13.37%, wherein perishable food items increased by 30% YoY mainly due to increase in prices of Vegetables and Fruits; c) At month end, PKR closed at 185.69 against USD due to continued pressure on forex reserves on account of high CAD and external debt repayments.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 61% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases fell substantially by 60% to close at 3.45k at end of the month, compared to 8.69k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Fertilizer Sector contributed the most to the index i.e. 432 points as investors jumped into the high dividend yield stocks. On the contrary, Cements contributed negatively to the index the most by 400 points.

Resolution of the recent Political crisis, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
