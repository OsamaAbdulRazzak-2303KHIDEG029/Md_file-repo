Fund Managers' Report August 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

During the month of August, concerns regarding the economy re-emerged as the anticipated board-level approval from the IMF got delayed. The USD 7.0 billion IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program faced deferral due to a gap in external financing, with Pakistan struggling to secure timely debt rollover from friendly countries. However, recent updates indicate that the government is optimistic about meeting IMF conditions, as efforts to close the external financing gap are progressing well.

In August 2024, the country’s exports rose by 18.9% month-on-month (MoM) to USD 2.74 billion, while imports increased by 4.9% to USD 4.42 billion, leading to a 12.0% reduction in the trade deficit to USD 1.68 billion. PKR remained stable compared to the greenback at 278.5 due to balanced external flows. Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for the month of August 2024 dropped to 9.6%, down from 11.1% in July, marking the lowest level in 34 months.

Core inflation also declined, reaching 11.9%—the lowest in 27 months—compared to 13.8% the previous month. Inflation is expected to decelerate further in the coming months as the base effect becomes more pronounced, with CPI anticipated to average around 7.9% for FY25. Given the significantly positive real interest rates, further interest rate cuts are expected, with the policy rate projected to fall to around 13%-15% by June 2025.

On the fiscal front, FBR tax collection increased by 20.1% in the first two months of FY25 to PKR 1,456 billion, though it fell short of the target by PKR 98 billion.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation for August 2024 dropped to 9.6%, down from 11.1% in July, marking the lowest rate in 34 months. Core inflation also declined, reaching 11.9%—the lowest in 27 months—compared to 13.8% the previous month. Inflation is expected to decelerate further in the coming months as the base effect becomes more pronounced, with CPI anticipated to average around 9%-10% for FY25.

In August, short-term secondary market yields fell by an average of 132 basis points (bps), while longer-term yields decreased by 67 bps. This decline reflects market expectations of an anticipated rate cut of 150-200 bps in the upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for September 12, 2024. On August 21, 2024, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) held a Treasury bill auction with a total maturity of PKR 184 billion, surpassing the target of PKR 150 billion.

The SBP accepted bids totaling PKR 76.0 billion for 3-month, PKR 156.7 billion for 6-month, and PKR 126.0 billion for 12-month tenors, with cut-off yields of 17.49%, 17.75%, and 17.00%, respectively. The cut-off yields declined by an average of 159 bps compared to the previous month’s auction, influenced by expectations of an interest rate reduction. There was no fixed coupon PIB auction during the month.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent levels and remain at level of 7%-9% on a consistent basis due to stability in currency along with favorable base effect. Monetary easing is expected to continue going forward potentially resulting in a reduction of 4%-6% in the policy rate over the next Fiscal year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program, any abrupt devaluation of PKR, volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict remain significant risks to our forecasts.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

In August 2024, the equity market in Pakistan remained relatively flat, marking a 0.77% return throughout the month. However, it experienced volatility as the market touched a low of 77,084 and closed at 78,488 points. After reaching the staff-level agreement with the IMF on July 12, 2024; Pakistan is yet to be scheduled for board level approval meeting. This remains the key reason behind market being stagnant at current level.

Foreign investors maintained a significant presence with a net inflow of US$9.27 million this month, although down from the previous month's inflow of US$23.84 million. Foreign purchases were primarily focused on the Technology, Commercial Banks, and Power sectors.

During the month, global rating agency Moody’s raised Pakistan’s local and foreign currency issuer ratings, as well as its senior unsecured debt ratings, from Caa3 to Caa2. The rating agency believes that there is greater certainty on the country sources of external financing following the staff level agreement of $7 Billion. The outlook given by Moody is that the Government might be unable to lower its liquidity and external vulnerability risks and achieve a better fiscal position.

The Government's strong commitment to economic reforms, adherence to the IMF program, and focus on fiscal consolidation have greatly enhanced investor confidence in Pakistan’s economy and stock market. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to stay lower, mainly due to a higher base effect. However, rising utility tariffs could push inflation beyond expectations as manufacturers may pass on increased costs to consumers.

A potential market rally could be sparked by significant investments from friendly countries and ongoing monetary easing. Additionally, with the KSE-100 Index currently trading at a price-to-earnings ratio (PER) of 4x, significantly below its 10-year average of 7.2x, valuations remain attractive.
