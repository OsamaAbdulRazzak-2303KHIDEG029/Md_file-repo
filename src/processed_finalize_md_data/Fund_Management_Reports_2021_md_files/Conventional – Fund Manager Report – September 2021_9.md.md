Fund Managers' Report September 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit (CAD) in Aug’21 stood at US$1,476mn, compared to a surplus of US$255mn in same period last year. The deficit is mainly due to extraordinary rise of 85% YoY in goods imports, dominating the impact of increase in worker’s remittances (+27% YoY) and goods exports (+55% YoY). Breakup of imports displays escalation of 103% YoY in petroleum imports on account of higher international oil prices and 16% increase in volume. Furthermore, transport and textile groups registered a rise in imports by 154% YoY and 98% YoY respectively.

In the latest monetary policy meeting held during the month of Sep’21, SBP raised the policy rate by 25 bps after keeping it constant at 7% since Jun’20 in order to support the revival of economy from distress experienced due to outspread of Covid-19. The SBP noted that, economic recovery has now surpassed expectations amid demand-led growth, while the impact of Covid on economic activity remains muted due to continued vaccination drive by the Government.

PKR continued to depreciate against the greenback reaching all-time peak level of 170.66 at Sep’21 end, as depreciation for the month of September stood at 2.5%, taking cumulative depreciation to 11% from recent low of 152.3 hit during the month of May. Moreover, foreign exchange reserves declined by US$1bn to US$26bn in Sep’21. The drop in foreign exchange reserves was attributed to huge CAD and external debt repayments.

Headline inflation of 9% for the month of Sep’21 was higher than street consensus, mainly driven by higher commodity prices. Further increase in oil prices, Petroleum Development levy and power tariffs are key risks to the Government’s target inflation of 8.2% in FY22.

Based on provisional figures, fiscal collection in 1QFY22 stood at PKR 1.395trn versus target of PKR 1.21trn (up 15%). The higher than estimated collection would likely help in curtailing the fiscal deficit of the country.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the reviewed month, SBP announced its monetary policy statement for the next two months, increasing the policy rate by 25 bps to 7.25%. The shift in policy stance was made after 18 long months, as the country was deeply affected by COVID since March 2020. SBP Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) was of the view that this shift in policy stance is needed to gradually pivot from catalyzing the economic recovery after COVID shocks towards sustaining it. Over the last few months, significant rise in imports have been seen owing to the pickup in demand coupled with hefty rise in international commodity prices. The burden of rising current account deficit fell on the exchange rate and, MPC found it appropriate to adjust the policy rate in order to protect the longevity of growth stance, while keeping the inflation expectation well anchored and reducing the growth of current account deficit.

The Yield curve gradually skewed upwards as few of the market participants were of the view that the discount rate would increase contrary to other. After the policy rate announcement, the yields across all tenors adjusted substantially by 30 to 120 bps. SBP conducted T-bill auction twice during the month. The last T-bill auction was held after the policy announcement and cut–off yields stretched upwards by 43 and 48 bps in 3 months and 6 months tenor. The auction details of last T-bill auction is as follows: Total maturity in the auction was PKR 895 billion, while total participation in the auction was PKR 1,139 billion. SBP accepted PKR 689 billion in 3 months and PKR 39 billion in 6 months only, while rejecting 12 month participation. The cut-off of 3 months and 6 months settled at 7.6388 & 7.9798% respectively.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on 15th September, 2021 with a total target of PKR XX billion. Total participation of only PKR 189 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10, & 15 year tenor received bids worth PKR 51 billion, PKR 53 billion, PKR 69 billion, & PKR 15 billion respectively. State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 18 billion in 3 years, PKR 23.5 billion in 5 years, 36 billion in 10 years & PKR 15 billion in 15 year at a Cut-off rate of 8.88%, 9.18%, and 9.83% & 10.40% respectively.

Going forward, as indicated in last monetary policy statement, the policy will remain largely accommodative in the near term and a gradual adjustment will be made in order to achieve the mildly positive real rate over time. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index witnessed an attrition of 5.31% during the month of September to close at 44,900 points. The average daily turnover increased by 17% on MoM basis as it clocked at 149mn compared to previous month’s level of 127mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$44.94mn compared to a net outflow of US$9.87mn in August, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$41.64mn) while there was net buying in Technology amounting to US$7.82mn.

Key developments during the month include a) SBP increased policy rate by 25bps signaling departure from the accommodative stance it had maintained for over 17 months. The Central bank now expects gradual increase in policy rate in future to achieve mildly positive real interest rates in order to curtail overheating of the economy and contain luxury imports; b) PKR depreciated by another 2.5% during the month, as imports for the month of September clocked at a level of US$6.48bn; c) CAD amounted to US$1.49bn for the month of August on the back of increase in imports due to rising commodity prices and increase in demand and d) MSCI downgraded Pakistan to Frontier market, effective from Dec 01, 2021.

Government’s vaccination drive has stepped up extraordinarily since 3 months, as fully vaccinated personnel registered growth of 58% compared to last month and currently stand at 31.63mn i.e. 14.2% of the total population, while partially vaccinated total currently stands at 62mn, so a huge increase is expected in vaccinated personnel in the coming months as well. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases decreased by staggering 49%, and stood at 48.16k at the end of the month, compared to 93.9 at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Companies in Miscellaneous segment contributed the most to the index i.e. 182 points. On the contrary, Cements contributed negatively to the index the most by 752 points.

Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and Covid-19 infections will determine market direction in the near term.
