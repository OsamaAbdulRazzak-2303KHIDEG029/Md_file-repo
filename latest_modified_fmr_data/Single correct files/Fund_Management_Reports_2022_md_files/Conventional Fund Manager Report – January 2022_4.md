Fund Managers' Report January 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit (CAD) in Dec’21 stood at US$1,932mn as compared to a deficit of US$629mn in same period last year due to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit reached to US$9.09bn in 1HFY22 versus a surplus of US$1.25bn in 1HFY21 on account of bull-run in the commodity cycle, along with increased economic activity. The commodity prices continued their upward trajectory due to supply constraints and no major effect on global demand because of outspread of omicron variant. The international oil prices soared to above US$90/bbl for the first time since 2014 posing risks to balance of payment.

On the flip side, SBP kept the policy rate unchanged at 9.75% in the Jan’22 Monetary Policy meeting. The SBP noted that cumulative rise of 275 basis points in the policy rate since Sep’21, regulatory tightening of consumer finance and curtailment of non-essential imports would keep inflation in the range of 5%-7% in the medium term ensuring stable and sustainable growth in economy.

Other notable developments in Jan’22 was approval of mini-budget and State Bank of Pakistan (Amendments) Bill which paved way for the release of US$1bn tranche from the IMF. The tranche will support the dwindling foreign exchange reserves which currently stands at US$22bn.

Large Scale Manufacturing Index growth during Jul-Nov’21 growth stands at 3.26% over July-Nov’20. During Nov’21, production of Automobile, Iron & Steel products witnessed a rise of 34.5% YoY and 25.3% YoY respectively. On the other hand, decline in production of fertilizers and electronics contributed negatively to the index.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In line with the forward guidance provided in the last monetary policy statement, Monetary policy committee (MPC) decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 9.75%. MPC was of the view that the earlier measures taken are appropriate enough to curb the inflation, support growth and maintain external stability. Market reacted positively to the forward looking approach and took fresh bets across all tenors. In addition to it, the regular OMOs injections made by the central bank skewed down the shorter end of the curve. On an average, short term yields declined by 35bps while longer tenor yields decreased by around 60bps during the month.

In the last T-bill auction held on 26th Jan, 2022. The auction had a total maturity of PKR 794bn against a target of PKR 650bn. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 2,130bn. Out of total participation bids worth, PKR 644bn were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 928bn in 6 months, and PKR 557bn in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 478bn in 3 months’, PKR 123bn in 6 months’ and PKR 99bn in 12 months’ at a cut-off yield of 10.2999%, 10.69%, and 10.9250%, respectively.

Auction for Fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on Jan 27th, 2022 with a total target of PKR 100bn. The SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 83bn in 3 years, PKR 40bn in 05 years & PKR 10bn in 10 years at cut off rates of 10.79%, 10.86% and 10.97% respectively. The cutoff declined by an average 74 basis point when compared to last cut off of 11.50%, 11.57% and 11.76% respectively.

Auction for Semi-annual Floating Rate Bond was held on Jan 26th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 50bn. SBP rejected all the bids. Auction for Fortnightly Reset - Quarterly Payment Coupon floating Rate Bond was held on Jan 26th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 25bn. SBP accepted bids worth PKR 17.50bn at a cutoff price of 99.1698.

Resumption of IMF program will come up with stringent conditions and government will need to make tough decisions in order to address the fiscal imbalances. As indicated earlier, the inflationary expectation of the government is largely dependent upon the global commodity prices. Any respite from the global commodity prices especially crude oil will stabilize growth momentum and maintain interest rates in the near term.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index displayed return of 1.75% during the month of January to close at 45,375 points. The average daily volume decreased by 4.21% on MoM basis as it clocked at 99.75mn compared to previous month’s level of 104.13mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$17.57mn compared to a net inflow of US$5.26mn in December, where the buying was concentrated in Technology (US$19.29mn) while there was net selling in Oil and Gas marketing companies amounting to US$1.51mn.

Key developments during the month include a) The Government successfully managed to pass mini budget ending tax exemptions worth PKR 343bn along with the SBP Autonomy bill (pre-requisites to IMF programme resumption); b) CPI for the month of January clocked in at 12.96%, wherein electricity index increased by 14.2% due to adjustment in fuel charges and c) Central Bank in the latest meeting held on Jan 24, 2022 maintained policy rate at 9.75%. As per the monetary policy committee (MPC), current real interest rates are appropriate to control inflation in the medium term and support growth.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 50% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases surged by a massive 938% to close at 105.68k at end of the month, compared to 10.184k at the end of last month due to highly contagious Omicron variant.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 466 points. On the contrary, Technology contributed negatively to the index the most by 333 points.

Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
