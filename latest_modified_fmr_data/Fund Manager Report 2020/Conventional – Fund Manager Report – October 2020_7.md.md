Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report October 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy continued its sharp recovery in October. Current Account registered a surplus of US$ 70mn for September’20 compared to a deficit of US$ 278 mn in September’19. For 2MFY20, the surplus is USD 792 mn as compared to a deficit of USD 1490 mn in SPLY. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation. Exports during September ’20 showed an increase of 4% YoY mainly due to an increase in textile exports. Foreign remittances depicted a surprising increase of 31% YoY for September’20, despite the fact that COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of expatriates across the globe.

Foreign exchange reserves decreased by ~US$ 32 mn during the month to close at US$ 19.5 bn as of 29 October, 2020, mainly due to debt repayments. Nevertheless, PKR appreciated by 3% against USD during the month. Expected monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions and inflows through Roshan Pakistan Savings accounts should provide further support to the Rupee in the next few months.

CPI clocked in at a level of 8.9% for the month of October’20 which was lower than market consensus. The level of MoM Inflation was witnessed due to an increase in food prices amid supply disruptions. We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months mainly due to a high base effect. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP has kept the policy rate unchanged at 7 percent to continue the momentum of economic recovery, while raised its inflation forecasts to 7 -9%.

The Government is expecting a contraction of 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has set a GDP Growth target of 2.1% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July-Aug’20 taking the relevant index up by 3.6% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul-Aug’2020 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

However, the number of daily new COVID cases has increased to over 1,000 whereas active cases have increased to nearly 12,000 from a low of 6,000 earlier. Therefore, a second wave of infections cannot be ruled out.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

For the month under review, the headline inflation declined to 8.91%.

T-Bills in the secondary market witnessed a slight increase in yields across all tenors. However, PIB yields declined considerably during the month.

SBP conducted Treasury bill auctions twice during the month. Total cumulative realized amount in both the auctions was PKR 1,057.5bn. Cut off yields stood at 7.1580%, 7.20% and 7.2753% for 3, 6 and 12 month tenors respectively.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 13.05 billion against the total participation of PKR 57.675 billion. The cut-off for 3 years, 15 years and 20 year tenors stood at 8.24%, 9.99%, 10.5498% respectively whereas all bids were rejected in 5 and 10 years tenors.

Auction for floating rate bond also held twice during the month. Total participation was PKR 133.07bn. SBP accepted around PKR 94.07 billion. The cut-off prices of 3 year/5 year/10 year stood at 100.3372/100.3825/100.0347 respectively.

So far, the economy has shown early signs of recovery post COVID pandemic, as the ease in lockdowns and growth in exports have bode well to increase confidence of the businesses. However, the rise in inflation is the major point of concern and challenge for the monetary authorities to stimulate the economy in order to continue the growth momentum. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index witnessed extreme volatility during the month of October 2020, as the index corrected by 3.7% in the first 3 trading sessions of the month to a level of 39,072 points. Extreme buying interest at lower stock prices resulted in a positive return of 7.1% in the next 15 sessions, however, the index failed to close the month with this positivity as fears of a second wave of Covid and declining international markets due to lockdowns imposed in European countries resulted in selling pressure in the last 3 sessions of the local market as well, hence the bourse closed at 39,888 points (-1.68% MoM). The average daily turnover decreased by 25% on MoM basis as it clocked at 266mn in October, compared to previous month’s level of 355mn. Foreigners remained net sellers this month, as the net foreign outflow during October'2020 amounted to US$39.12mn as compared to a net outflow of US$33.30mn in September’2020, where the selling was concentrated in Cements (US$ 15.76mn) and Oil and Gas Exploration companies (US$ 8.77mn).

Key developments during the month included a) Pakistan remained in the grey list of FATF but compliance with the majority of the requirements and only a few pending points sent positive signals for the next review, b) great results for September quarter by almost all sectors including Banks, Cements, Steel, Packaging and Chemicals resulted in positivity in the market as investors’ confidence and interest increased, c) Current account surplus for the third consecutive month in September also lifted sentiments as signs of recovery in economic activity continue to appear.

Number of daily coronavirus cases stood in the range of 600 to 800 during the month of October, higher than 400 to 700 cases in the previous month. Number of cases have increased worldwide since the change in weather. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 315k compared to 297k in the last month, however, active cases increased from 8.8k in the previous month end to 12.5k during this month as daily cases outpaced recoveries during the month.

On a monthly basis, the Cement sector contributed the largest to the upside of KSE-100 index with 271 points mainly due to very impressive results posted in September quarter, followed by Automobiles with 71 points. On the contrary, Oil and Gas Exploration contributed negatively to the index the most by 525 points followed by Oil and Gas Marketing companies with 159 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals, expectations of rising Covid-19 infections & its impact on business operations, and any developments on the political front will determine market direction in the near term.
