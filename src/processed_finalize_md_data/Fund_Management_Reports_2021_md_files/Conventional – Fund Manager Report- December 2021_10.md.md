Fund Managers' Report December 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit (CAD) in Nov’21 registered at US$1,908mn as compared to a surplus of US$563mn in same period last year as imports of Nov ’21 of US$6.4bn recorded growth of more than 50% same period last year. Higher imports are mainly attributable to bull-run in commodity cycle globally and higher petroleum products imports. Decent growth was witnessed in goods exports of 21% while remittances remained almost flat 0.6%. However, was not sufficient to cover large imports in Nov’21.

Foreign exchange reserves as at end of Dec’21, stood at US$24.0bn from its highest level of US$27.2bn in Aug’21. Higher than expected imports raised concerns on depleting foreign exchange reserves, resultantly PKR/USD parity reached to its historic high level of 178.235 in Dec’21.

On the other hand, SBP raised policy rate by 100 basis points to 9.75% in Dec’21 on account of risks on inflation and balance of payments. The Central Bank noted that global commodity and energy prices, due to disruption in supply chains, have persisted on the higher side longer than expected. Elevated commodity prices (including food and energy) and upward fuel adjustment in power tariffs, caused inflation to stand at 21-month high level of 12.28% in Dec’21.

Large Scale Manufacturing Index growth slowed slightly in the month of Oct as Jul-Oct’21 growth stands at 3.56% over July-Oct 2020. During Oct’21, Non Metallic Mineral Products, Fertilizers, Electronics and Rubber Products declined by 12.27%, 6.69%, 30.17% and 34.37% respectively.

Moreover, the Government has proposed to pass Mini Budget to amend certain laws on taxes and duties to meet the IMF's conditions for clearance of Pakistan's sixth review of the $6 billion Extended Fund Facility.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In continuation to SBP’s tightening stance and forward looking approach, MPC raised the policy rate by another 100bps to 9.75% sighting risk related to inflation and widening trade deficit. This brought the cumulative rate hike to 275bps since September 2021 and as per the committee the goal of achieving a mildly positive interest rate is close to being achieved. Headline inflation for the month of December was a 22month high as it arrived at 12.30% Y/Y. This CPI incorporated the hike in the electricity charges on account of major increase in FCA during the month i.e PKR 4.75/unit. Increase in the prices of footwear along with higher cotton prices also supplemented to the spike. A decrease was witnessed in food inflation as it declined by 3.4% M/M.

Money management remained a challenge for the government as Banks demanded higher rate in the T-Bill auctions, and the government had no other option due to restrictions put up by IMF. In the last T-bill auction held on 30th Dec 21, the auction had a total maturity of PKR 1,114bn against a target of PKR 1,200bn. Total participation of approx. PKR 1,869bn was witnessed out of which bids worth PKR 983bn were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 610bn in 6 months, and PKR 276bn in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 650bn in 3 months’ tenor at a cut-off yield of 10.5902%, PKR 386bn in 6 months’ at a cut-off yield of 11.4501% and PKR 110bn in 12 months’ at a cut-off yield of 11.5100%.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on December 22nd, 2021 with a total target of PKR 100bn. The auction remained strong as a total participation of PKR 508bn was witnessed out of which 3, 5, 10 & 20 tenors received bids worth PKR 124bn, PKR 215bn, PKR 163bn & PKR 5bn respectively. SBP accepted bids worth 32bn in 3 years, 107bn in 05 years & 19bn in 10 years at a cutoff rate of 11.50%, 11.57% & 11.76% respectively. Bids in 20 years tenor were rejected.

The expectation for inflation given by the government are in the range of 9 – 11% for this fiscal year, but it would be largely dependent on the international commodities prices going forward, especially crude oil. If these prices ease going forward (as expected by SBP) we might see some stability in the interest rate scenario at the current levels. But any negativity from the commodity side accompanied with further elevation in the current account deficit will put pressure on the economy.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index posted negative return of 1.06% during the month of December to close at 44,596 points. The average daily volume decreased by 16.44% on MoM basis as it clocked at 104.13mn compared to previous month’s level of 124.6mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$5.26mn compared to a net outflow of US$141.34mn in November, where the buying was concentrated in Technology (US$3.43mn) while there was net selling in Cement amounting to US$2.37mn.

Key developments during the month include a) CPI for the month of December clocked in at 12.3%, wherein electricity index increased by 14.2% due to adjustment in fuel charges; b) Central Bank in the latest meeting held on Dec 14, 2021 raised policy rate by 100bps taking cumulative hike to 275bps during CY21. As per the monetary policy committee (MPC), monetary policy settings are expected to remain broadly unchanged in the near-term and c) the Government has proposed to pass Mini Budget to amend certain laws on taxes and duties to meet the IMF's conditions for clearance of Pakistan's sixth review of the $6 billion Extended Fund Facility.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 45% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases reduced by 28%, and stood at 10.18k at the end of the month, compared to 14.16k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Technology contributed the most to the index i.e. 283 points. On the contrary, Commercial Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 372 points.

Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
