Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report December 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The economy started seeing the impact of tightening monetary policy in the second half of the year with large scale manufacturing down by 0.65% in 4MFY19. For the month of October, LSM growth was up 0.95% YoY. The positive growth in Fertilizers, Paper & board and food and beverages sectors was more than offset by the petroleum products where OCAC data showed that output had decreased by 0.46% in 4MFY19 with furnace oil contributing most to the decline. In the auto sector, the production was down in most categories including tractors which went down by 6.57%, trucks by 15.6% and LCVs by 6.3% in the first five months of FY19. The slowing growth can be seen as a direct result of higher inflation and a weakening rupee, both of which continue to contain domestic demand. SBP projects real GDP growth for FY19 at slightly above 4%.

Fiscal position continued to worsen as foreign reserves reached alarmingly low levels - overall foreign reserves went down to USD14.0bn by end of November 2018 compared to USD20.2bn at end of December 2017. The current SBP reserves constitute import cover of merely 2x. The rupee also depreciated considerably throughout the year losing 26% of its value in CY18 down to PKR138.9/USD by end of December 2018 compared to PKR 110.7/USD at the end of 2017. The worsening external account position was due to only a meager increase in exports of 1% in 5MFY19 with exports at USD 9.1bn compared to USD 9.0bn in the same period last year. Imports were down to USD 23.6bn in 5MFY19 (5MFY18: USD 23.8bn) resulting in trade deficit of USD 14.5bn for the period against USD 14.8 bn in SPLY.

Going forward, we expect Pakistan-IMF talks to end soon and finalize some form of a funding package for Pakistan. Friendly countries like Saudi Arabia, UAE and China have already pledged to help Pakistan’s dwindling reserves either in form of depositing reserves, commercial loans, or delayed payments for oil. We expect these measures to contain the rupee depreciation in FY19. However, the tightening monetary measures like i) rising inflation which SBP estimates will be between 6.5-7.5% for FY19 and ii) high interest rates will continue to limit economic growth for the year. We see exports growing in FY19 given cost competitiveness and see imports growth to be lower in FY19 compared to FY18.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During CY18, Central bank raised rates by 425bps (from 6.25% to 10.25%) which is evident in below mentioned yield curve as well. Average inflation during the period hovered around 5.14% which is 105bps higher than CY17. The increase in discount rates was majorly effectuated to try to curb the twin deficits and to control the consistently declining forex reserves. During the year SBP raised PKR 19.6 trillion from Treasury bills compared to PKR 12.6 trillion in 2017, during the entire period market participants shied away from participating in longer tenure bonds as a result the central bank was able to raise only PKR 289 billion against the target of PKR 700 billion.

In order to entice the investors to longer tenures, the central bank for the first time issued floating rate bonds which received overwhelming response from the market participants as the total participation amounted to PKR 447 billion against the target of PKR 250 billion.

Owing to concerns of perceived overvalued domestic currency, increasing international oil prices and ballooning twin deficits resulted in PKR depreciation of approximately 25% against USD. On the Islamic front, no fresh GOP ijara was issued however Bai muajjal was conducted for the ijara which matured in December 2018.

Going forward, deteriorating current account deficit with hefty upcoming repayments and insufficient external inflows indicate economic instability where entry into the IMF program remains inevitable.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index declined by 8.4% in CY18 to close the year slightly above 37,000, with the largest drop seen in December 2018. In USD terms, the KSE-100 index was down by 26.5%, which is the worst annual return since CY08. Average daily turnover decreased by 5.8% to 96.6mn shares in CY18, which has seen consistent declines since CY15.

Broadly speaking, political uncertainty and weak macroeconomic environment kept the market under pressure throughout CY18. Key reasons behind the pressure include: i) steep increase in policy rate since the start of CY18 (+425bps in 2018), ii) several rounds of devaluation (26% depreciation against USD), iii) volatile global oil market raised fears on fiscal position, iv) change of government in Aug 2018 which failed to provide clarity on its plans, v) delays in IMF programme in the wake of tough conditions and vi) deteriorating reserves position, leaving an import cover of less than two months (SBP reserves of USD 7.5bn as of 21st Dec).

Political uncertainty took the centre stage in 2018 due to elections scheduled in Jul 2018. PML (N) completed its tenure in May 2018 and handed the powers to the caretaker government for a period of ~2 months. The uncertainty propped up further post formation of new government in August 2018 as investors awaited the clarity on its plans to resolve the worsening external position. Moreover, the new government considered reentry into IMF program in which IMF proposed strict conditions to deal with fiscal position, including exchange rate flexibility, tightening monetary policy and rise in gas and power tariff. However, they failed to reach an agreement by the end of the year which kept the market at back foot.

The year saw a hefty foreign portfolio investment outflow of USD 537mn, making it the largest outflow in more than a decade. Moreover, 2018 marked as the fourth consecutive year of net foreign portfolio investment outflow. Banks were the major contributors to these outflows, mainly due to rising concerns on international operations and worsening economic conditions. This was followed by Oil & Gas Exploration companies, where the outflow was attributed to volatile global oil market dynamics.

Federal budget FY19 was largely positive for the stock market. The new measures which improved the market sentiments include i) gradual reduction in corporate tax to 25% by 2023, ii) change of taxation on stock brokers’ commission, iii) removal of 5% tax on bonus shares, iv) extension in tax incentives deadline for investments in plant and machinery, v) tax rationalization on undistributed profits and vi) continuation of super tax but at a lower rate. The new government also introduced a mini budget during mid-September 2018 which was targeted towards improvement in fiscal deficit by 210bps.

Oil & Gas Sector was the top contributor to the Index’s decline as it trimmed the Index by 747 points. This was led by rising oversupply risks post increasing US production. Arab Light prices were down by 16.7% YoY to close the year at USD 54.2/bbl (~36.9% down from its peak of USD 85.9/bbl seen in early October 2018). Several rounds of currency devaluation and volatile commodity prices kept the Cements under pressure in CY18, taking away 735 points from the index. During the year, Richard Bay coal prices touched a peak of USD 109.1/ton in July 2018, before coming down to USD 96.3/ton by the end of CY18. Imposition of penalties on Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and United Bank Limited (UBL) amid concerns on their international operations prompted the highest sell off in the banking sector, with these two banks alone chipping the index by 1,191 points in CY18. Fertilizers were the top performing sector which added 800 points to the index during the year. Improved margins environment is attributed to the sector performance. This was followed by Tobacco with an addition of 222 points in CY18.

Going forward, material progress on talks over financial support programs is likely to set the direction for the market. The government is expected to conclude the discussions with IMF and China in January 2019. Moreover, USD 3bn worth of oil facility on deferred payment from UAE is also anticipated to be finalized in January 2019, where USD 3bn package to support reserves has already been agreed upon.
