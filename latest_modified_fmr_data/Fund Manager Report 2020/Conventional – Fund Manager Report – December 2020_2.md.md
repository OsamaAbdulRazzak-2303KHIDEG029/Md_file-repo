Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report December 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy remained robust throughout December. Current Account registered a surplus of US$ 447mn for November’20 compared to a deficit of US$326 mn in same period last year. For 1QY21, the surplus stands at USD 1,640mn as compared to a deficit of USD 1,745mn in 1QFY20. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures, significant PKR devaluation and steps taken for import substitution. Exports during Nov ’20 showed an increase of 5.5% YoY mainly due to increase in textile exports. Foreign remittances maintained their strong trend and depicted surprising increase of 28.4% YoY for Nov’20, despite the fact that COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of expatriates across the globe.

Foreign exchange reserves remained largely flat and decreased by ~USD 13mn during the month to close at USD 20.2bn as of 29 December, 2020, mainly due to multilateral inflows and current account stability. PKR depreciated by 0.3% against USD during the month. Expected monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions and inflows through Roshan Pakistan Savings accounts should provide further support to the Rupee in next few months, thus ruling out significant devaluation for rest of FY21.

CPI clocked in at a level of 7.97% for the month of Dec’20 which was in line with market consensus. The level of MoM Inflation was witnessed due to increase in food prices amid supply disruptions and rise in electricity charges. We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months mainly due to a high base effect and government measures to control food prices and crackdown on hoarding. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP has kept policy rate unchanged at 7% to continue the momentum of economic recovery, while raised its inflation forecasts to 7-9%.

Pakistan’s economy contracted by 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has set a GDP Growth target of 2.1% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. We think the former projection will turn out to be more accurate. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July -Oct’20 taking relevant index up by 5.5% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul-Oct’2020 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

Short-term risks remain due to the second wave of COVID-19. The number of daily new cases has increased to over 2,000 whereas active cases have increased to more than 35,000 from a low of 6,000 earlier. Therefore, government has imposed restrictions on social gatherings and business timings, although schools and other educational institutes are planned to be reopened from January. Nevertheless, long-term outlook remains bright for the economy as multiple vaccines have proven to be effective against the virus in trials and a public rollout is on the horizon, as the Government has started to make appropriate arrangements.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

For the month under review, the head line inflation declined to 7.97%.

T-Bills in the secondary market witnessed slight increase in yields across all tenors. On the other hand, movement in secondary market PIB yields remained mixed.

SBP conducted Treasury bill auctions thrice during the month. Total cumulative realized amount in all the auctions were PKR 1,444bn. Cut off yields stood at 7.1090%, 7.1911% and 7.2877% for 3, 6 and 12 month tenors respectively.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 13.27 billion. The cut-off for 3 years, 15 years and 20 year tenors stood at 8.24%, 10.00%, 10.5624% respectively whereas all bids were rejected in 5 and 10 years tenor.

So far, economy has shown early signs of recovery post COVID pandemic, as the ease in lock downs and growth in exports have boded well to increase confidence of the businesses. However, higher inflation is the major point of concern and challenge for the monetary authorities to stimulate the economy in order to continue the growth momentum. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The bourse closed the year on a positive note as the benchmark index posted a return of 6.54% during the month of December to close at 43,755 points. On yearly basis, the index depicted a positive return of 7.4%, despite witnessing extreme volatility during the year due to Covid-19. The average daily turnover increased by 65% on MoM basis as it clocked at 266mn in December, compared to previous month’s level of 161mn. Foreigners remained net sellers this month, as the net foreign outflow during Dec’20 amounted to US$96.34mn as compared to a net outflow of US$47.19mn in Nov’20, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$30.11mn) and Fertilizers (US$10.41mn).

Key developments during the month included a) PM announced to prolong the deadline for amnesty scheme for construction industry; b) Approval of policy for Electric vehicles by ECC; and c) Current account surplus for fifth consecutive month in November. All lifted investor confidence as signs of recovery in economic activity continue to appear.

Number of daily coronavirus cases decreased to almost 2000 in the latter part of the month of December compared to more than 3000 during end of last month and start of December as well. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 437k compared to 343k in the last month, however, active cases stand at 34.7k in the previous month end to 49.1k by end of the month as recoveries outpaced daily cases accretion.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 406 points, the investors started chasing attractive valuations and dividend yield on offer, followed by Technology which contributed 349 points to the index. On the contrary, Sugar and allied industries contributed negatively to the index the most by -2 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals, Covid-19 infections, the possible rollout of vaccines & its impact on business operations will determine market direction in the near term.
