Fund Managers' Report March 2017

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI inflation in March 2017 stood at 4.9% vs. 4.2% in Feb 2017, up 0.8% MoM. This boosted the CPI to two-year high, driven mainly by food inflation. The increase was mainly in poultry (up 28%), fresh fruits (15%) and vegetables (8%). During the month of Feb 2017 CAD stood at USD 0.7bn as against USD 1.2bn in Jan 2017 and a current account surplus of USD 0.5bn in Feb 2016. Henceforth, 8MFY17 CAD stands at USD5.4bn (2.6% of GDP) vs. USD2.4bn (1.3% of GDP) in 8MFY16. Exports remained stagnant despite various incentives announced by the GoP. Additionally, no major support was witnessed from worker’s remittances (which shrank by -2.5% YoY) particularly from GCC countries (63.4% of the total remittances). Though higher machinery imports are widely held responsible for widening trade deficit, it is relevant to highlight that machinery imports have only risen by USD 493 million or 10% YoY. A combination of low interest rates and currency overvaluation has surged the demand for non-oil non-machinery imports; as a result core trade has recorded a massive deficit of USD 4.5 billion in 8MFY17. After three years of consolidation under IMF program, fiscal deficit can be seen widening from 1.7% of GDP in 1HFY16 to 2.4% of GDP in 1HFY17 as political / popular decisions are taking priorities over economic decisions in the wake of approaching 2018 general election.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, SBP conducted three T-bill auction with a cumulative target of 800bn against the maturity of PKR 712.5bn. Cumulative participation was primarily witnessed in 6-months tenure followed by 3-months. SBP maintained the cut-off for 3-months 6-months and 12-months at 5.94%, 5.98% and 5.99% respectively for 1st two auctions. However, in the last T-bill auction held on 29 March 2017 SBP raised the cut-off yields by 5 to 2 bps in 3-month (5.99%) and 6-month (6.01%), respectively; no bids were received in 12-month T-bills which reflects market participants’ comfort level in shorter tenure. The central bank conducted a PIB auction on 22 march 2017, the cutoff yield on the bonds remained relatively flat, and the central bank was able to fetch only PKR 28bn, which is lower than the pre-auction target of PKR 50bn which shows market participants’ requirement of higher yields in the longer term. The recent shift in investment mix of market participants in T-bills from PIBs indicates market expectation of no major change in SBP’s monetary policy stance in the short run while hedging from risks emanating from higher inflation and widening trade and current account deficits which may exert pressure on the prevalent interest rate regime in the medium term.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index shrunk by 0.78% in March-17 as investor’s apprehensively awaited decision on Panama case. The KSE-100 Index closed at 48,155.93 for the month of March. In addition, SECP’s crackdown on brokers misappropriating in house financing continued to trouble the market. Major positive developments for March 2017 include progress on MFS product, inclusion of six Pakistani stocks into FTSE World Asia-Pacific (ex-Japan) index and release of PSX sales proceeds. Average daily traded value for KSE-ALL and KSE-100 index declined by 30% MoM and 27% MoM respectively. The KSE-ALL shares traded averaged at 246mn in Mar-17 vs. 354mn in the previous month. The volumes however were up 69% YoY. Average value traded likewise stood at PKR 11.7bn in Mar-17 versus PKR 16.9bn in Feb-17. In addition, Foreigners once again were net sellers offloading their holdings by USD 22.8mn in Mar-17, taking 9MFY17 net outflow to USD 461mn compared to net outflow of USD 351mn seen in 9MFY16. During the month of March the worst performing Sector were software and telecom (trailing KSE100 by 5.9/2.7% MoM, respectively), while life insurance and multi-utilities stood as the top performers (beating KSE100 by 14.5/11.6% MoM, respectively). The index heavy weights; banks, oil & gas, chemicals and cements once again showed nominal deviation from KSE-100.
