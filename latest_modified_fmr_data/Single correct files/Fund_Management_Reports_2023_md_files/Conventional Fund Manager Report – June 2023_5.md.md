Fund Managers' Report June 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia -Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3 -12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

Inflation has fallen below 30% after 4 consecutive months of 30% plus readings. For the month of June, inflation clocked at 29.4% compared to 37.97% in May. High base effect and fall in food and petroleum prices were key reasons for the decline. Going forward, inflation is expected to continue to fall in the coming months because of a high base, albeit, at elevated levels of mid 20s till December 2023. However, the impact of budgetary taxes and increase in utility tariffs may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May -2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

In response to rising inflation, the Central Bank conducted an emergent monetary policy meeting on June 26, 2023, in which the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to increase policy rate by 100 basis points to 22% citing deterioration in inflation outlook due to expected adjustment in energy prices, recent budgetary measures to increase tax revenue and withdrawal of restriction on imports. Moreover, the MPC highlighted that barring unexpected shocks, the policy rate of 22% has pushed the real interest rate in positive territory on a forward-looking basis.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

The Current Account posted a deficit of US$2.94 billion for 11MFY23 as against a deficit of US$15.16 billion during the same period last year (down 81%). For the month of May ’23, the Current account surplus stood at US$255 million compared to deficit of US$1.5 billion in May 2022, largely on the back of shrinkage in trade deficit due to decline in imports. Remittances during the month of May’23 declined by 10% compared to same period last year.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

Foreign exchange reserves increased to US$9.7bn at end of June compared to US$8.5bn at the end of last month mainly because of rollover funds received from China while PKR remained relatively stable during the month and depreciated by mere 0.18% during June.

On June 29, 2023, IMF reached staff level agreement with Pakistan on a US$3bn Stand -By Arrangement (SBA). This is a significant positive development for the country and will provide a framework for financial support from multilateral and bilateral partners and will help in tackling the external account problems, which the country is expected to face in the next 3 years because of massive debt servicing outflows.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

SBP held three T-Bill auctions during the month of June, with a target of PKR 5,250 billion against the maturity of PKR 4,925 billion. In the first auction, amount of PKR2,175 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.94% and 22.00% for 3-month, 6-month and 12 months’ tenure. In the second auction, an amount of around PKR 2099 billion was accepted at a cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.99% and 22.00% for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months’ tenures. In the third auction, an amount of around PKR 2304 billion was accepted at a cut-off yields of 22.00%, 21.97% and 22.00% for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months’ tenures.

In the PIB auction, bids amounting to PKR 127 billion were realized for 3-years at a cut-off yield of 19.35%, whereas bids for 5-years and 10 years were rejected. No bids were received for 15 years, 20 years and 30 years’ tenures.

Keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Central Bank in near future, so any further hike in policy rate cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a return of 0.3% during the month of June to close at 41,453 points. The average daily volume increased by 3% on MoM basis as it clocked at 79.36mn compared to previous month’s level of 76.85mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$6.26mn compared to a net outflow of US$3.51mn in May, where the buying was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$1.39mn) while there was net selling in Fertilizers amounting to US$0.33mn. On a monthly basis, Chemical contributed the most to the index i.e. 276 points. On the contrary, Fertilizer sector contributed negatively to the index the most by 272 points.

The index displayed a positive return of 1.97% in the first week of June as investors stayed eager to the possible announcement of bonus shares after budget in response to tax imposed on undistributed reserves. However, the Government decided to let go the proposal to tax the undistributed reserves and instead imposed taxation on bonus shares along with new taxation measures in order to reduce the fiscal deficit in the coming year. Sentiments turned to negative and the index fell by 4.9% to 40,065 points on June 23, 2023, before a rally kicked off in the final 2 days in the hope of revival in IMF program leading the index to close at 41,453 on June 27, 2023.

We believe, the approval of SBA by the IMF board in July will be a significant positive development for the Equity market. Sectors like E&Ps, Power Generation and Oil & Gas Marketing Companies can benefit from the expected hike in utility tariffs. Valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently.
