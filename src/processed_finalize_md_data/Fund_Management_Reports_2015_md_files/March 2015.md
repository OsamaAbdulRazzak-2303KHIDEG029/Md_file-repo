Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for March 2015 made another low by clocking in at 2.49% YoY. Period inflation for 9MFY15 now stands at 5.1% compared to 8.6% in the corresponding period last year. Food inflation was the only sub-head which saw a profound MoM hike of 0.55%, while other key heads remained mostly flat on monthly basis - resulting in overall MoM inflation of 0.23%.

Despite a cumulative 200bps policy rate cut since November 2014, real interest rate still stands at a hefty 5.5%, highest since August 2003. This hints at further monetary easing to support economic growth and increase demand for loanable funds.

Current account numbers posted a surplus of USD 877mn in February 2015 as opposed to deficit of USD 74mn in the preceding month. This is the highest monthly surplus since August 2012, owed primarily to CSF receipt of USD 700mn. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves held up comfortably at USD 16bn, and should increase further once IMF tranche is disbursed and HBL SPO is executed successfully.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The State Bank of Pakistan reduced the discount rate by another 50bps during March, bringing the key policy rate down to 8.0%. PIB yields inched lower by 24-29bps in the secondary market, yielding gains for money managers sitting on high bond exposures.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued with inflation clocking in at 2.49% for March 2015, demand for longer tenor bonds may continue to persist as the market FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism envisages further easing of 50-100bps. That said, interest may shift from longer tenor bonds to medium tenor or even shorter tenor bonds. In the previous auction, participation composition stood at 42% for 3Y PIB, 35% for 5Y PIB and 23% for 10Y PIB.

The month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability last seen in August 2010. No mop-ups were conducted during the month and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs. We believe the government will continue its cautious stance of steady easing as opposed to large one-time cuts. That said, with inflation below 3%, there is certainly ample room for further easing.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The equity market lost 10% over March 2015, pushing loss over the past two months to 14%. Consequently, return over 9MFY15 was clipped further to 2%. A correction of this magnitude was last seen in May 2010 when CGT was about to be implemented. We attribute this decline to tightened regulatory vigilance, hefty foreign selling and suspected un-rolling of leveraged financing.

Sector wise performance shows that Pharmaceuticals, Commercial Banks & Personal Goods underperformed the most over the month. Foods Producers and Electricity Sector lost the least value among the key sectors.

Interestingly, positive developments like decline in the discount rate, Moody's outlook upgrade on Pakistan Bonds, IMF's quarterly tranche disbursement and an external account surplus were all ignored by the market during this correction. This hefty fall on non-fundamental issues makes us optimistic that the market has the ability to recoup lost ground on abatement of investor apprehensions and external selling pressure.

A 19% correction in the index from its February 2015 high coupled with 50bps rate cut in March has made valuations attractive across the board. Investors with a medium-term horizon should see decent gains from here onwards.
