They invest in a number of companies across a broad section of industries/sectors. With a small investment, an investor can achieve diversification that would have otherwise not been possible if the investor invests directly in those securities.\n- Liquidity \u2013 Open-ended Mutual Funds are priced daily and can be redeemed anytime. This means that investors can redeem their holdings in Mutual Funds anytime.\n- Low transaction costs \u2013 Since Mutual Funds are a pool of money of many investors, the amount of investment made in securities is large. A small management fee is charged by the company, which if invested directly would have cost an individual investor a lot.\n- Transparency \u2013 Prices of open ended Mutual Funds are publicly announced daily. The portfolio is also disclosed in the monthly Fund Managers Report."
