Fund Managers' Report October 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

In October 2024, Central Bank’s foreign exchange reserves, supported by the receipt of first tranche from IMF, surged to USD 11.2 billion, marking the highest level since April 2022. Meanwhile, inflation ticked up to 7.2% in October from 6.9% in September, primarily driven by increase in food prices. However, inflation is expected to ease in the coming months as the high base effect comes into play. With real interest rates remaining robustly positive, further cuts in the policy rate are anticipated, with projections suggesting a decline to between 12.0% and 13.0% by June 2025.

Pakistan's export performance continued to show positive momentum, rising by 4.9% month-on-month to reach USD 2.98 billion. Conversely, imports fell by 3.9%, bringing the total to USD 4.47 billion. This resulted in a 17.7% reduction in the trade deficit, which narrowed to USD 1.50 billion. Additionally, remittances are forecasted to exceed USD 3.0 billion, potentially supporting a strong current account surplus for the month.

On the fiscal front, Pakistan achieved a historic milestone with its first quarterly budget surplus since 2QFY04. This surplus was largely driven by the State Bank of Pakistan’s extraordinary profits, bolstered by record-high interest rates and significant petroleum levy revenues. The fiscal surplus reached a record PKR 1.7 trillion, with the primary balance standing at PKR 3.0 trillion.

In the energy sector, the government is in discussions with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to renegotiate Power Purchase Agreements, aiming to reduce capacity payments and ultimately the electricity prices in order to provide relief to consumers. However, significant changes could potentially discourage future foreign investment.

Despite signs of economic recovery, challenges persist. Rising taxes and declining real wages are eroding consumer purchasing power, while political tensions are intensifying as the ruling coalition pushes for constitutional amendments, raising concerns about the democratic process. Regional conflicts and a fragile law and order situation also pose risks, particularly in relation to global commodity price fluctuations. As the country navigates these complexities, the emphasis remains on implementing effective policies to ensure sustainable growth and stability.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In October 2024, short-term secondary market yields fell by an average of 152 basis points (bps), while longer-term yields saw a smaller decline of 26 bps. This drop in yields was largely driven by market expectations of an additional interest rate cut of around 200 bps during the monetary policy meeting on November 4, 2024. Moreover, the SBP's buyback of Market Treasury Bills (MTBs) contributed to further downward pressure on secondary market yields.

On October 30, 2024, the SBP held a Treasury Bill auction, which had a total maturity of PKR 893 billion, well above the target of PKR 400 billion. The SBP accepted bids totaling PKR 168.1 billion for 3-month bills, PKR 133.4 billion for 6-month bills, and PKR 446.4 billion for 12-month bills, with the following cut-off yields: 13.90%, 13.50%, and 13.10%, respectively. Additionally, on October 17, 2024, the SBP conducted an auction for fixed-coupon Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) with a target of PKR 200 billion. The accepted bids included PKR 33.0 billion for 2-year PIBs, PKR 30.4 billion for 3-year PIBs, PKR 68.0 billion for 5-year PIBs, and PKR 65.9 billion for 10-year PIBs, at the following cut-off rates: 13.24%, 12.50%, 12.79%, and 12.98%, respectively.

Looking ahead, the outlook for inflation remains positive, supported by the stability of the currency and favorable base effects. The reduction in inflation, along with improvements in the external account following Pakistan's entry into the IMF program, provides the SBP with sufficient room to continue its cycle of monetary easing. However, the timing and pace of further rate cuts will depend on factors such as the trend in foreign exchange reserves, the external economic environment, and domestic political developments.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index maintained its upward trend throughout October, reaching an all-time high of 90,864 points. This rally was fueled by strong corporate earnings and improved liquidity for companies affected by circular debt, boosting investor confidence. Additionally, a sharp drop in inflation to a 44-month low of 6.9% in September raised expectations for further interest rate cuts, heightening market optimism. Although some profit-taking occurred towards month-end, the index closed strong at 88,966 points, up 7,853 points, or 9.7% month-on-month.

The Fertilizer, Banking, and E&P sectors led the rally, contributing 1,669, 1,492, and 1,399 points to the index, respectively. Fertilizer stocks were particularly attractive due to high dividend yields, while banks benefited from declining secondary market yields resulting in expectations of large capital gains in upcoming quarters. The E&P sector also saw increased investor interest as the previous gas price hikes strengthened liquidity and cash flows for the sector. Conversely, the Power sector underperformed, reducing the index by 266 points due to the government’s renegotiations and contract terminations with Independent Power Producers (IPPs), impacting sentiment in the sector.

In October, the average traded value surged by 58.6% month-on-month, reflecting growing interest in large-cap stocks, though total trading volume declined slightly by 1.5%. Foreign investors recorded net outflows of USD 75 million, primarily due to FTSE rebalancing. Domestic investors also contributed to outflows, with banks and individuals withdrawing USD 38 million and USD 17 million, respectively. However, these outflows were largely offset by inflows from mutual funds and corporate investors, amounting to USD 69 million and USD 35 million, respectively.

The equity market remains an attractive investment avenue, bolstered by decline in interest rates that support stock performance. While corporate profitability has improved, stock valuations have yet to fully reflect this growth, partly due to prevailing economic uncertainty. The market remains undervalued, with a P/E ratio of 4.32x compared to a 10-year average of 7.37x, suggesting substantial potential for re-rating.
