## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing data continues to point towards weakening of the economy. For 9MFY19, large scale manufacturing was down 2.9% YoY. The contraction was seen across all sectors with food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, iron and steel products and autos leading the decline. Inflation continues to remain elevated coming in at 8.8% for the month of April driven by higher prices of perishable food items as well as higher energy prices. Rupee remained volatile, and further depreciated by 4.6% in May to close at PKR 148/US$, compared to PKR 141.4/US$ at the end of April. According to the Economic Survey of Pakistan, FY19 GDP growth is likely to come in at 3.3% which is below SBP’s target of 3.5-4% and lower than last year’s growth of 5.2%.

Fiscal position remained worrisome with overall foreign exchange reserves as of May 31, 2019 stood at US$ 14.9bn, down from the peak of US$ 17.4bn at the end of March. Current Account deficit for the month of April came in at US$ 1.2bn, wider than March’s deficit. The situation is precarious given the import cover has fallen to below 2 months. For 10MFY19, CAD stands at US$ 11.6bn, down from US$ 15.9bn in the same period last year. Exports during the first ten months were down 1.9% YoY to US$ 20.1bn while imports were down 4.9% YoY. The trade deficit in 10MFY19 stood at US$ 23.9bn, lower than its last year’s level of US$ 25.8bn while remittances went up to US$ 17.9bn from US$ 16.5bn during SPLY.

During the month, Pakistan finalized a US$ 6bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from IMF for 3 years. Under the program, Pakistan needs to contain primary deficit at 0.6% of GDP while a market-determined exchange rate will be implemented to support the financial sector and better resource allocation within the country. On May 20, SBP announced an interest rate hike of 150bps in its monetary policy statement given elevated levels of inflation in the economy. With the budget to be announced on June 11, the focus will likely remain on bringing fiscal policy into balance through higher taxes and limits on overall expenditure.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of Apr2019, the bond market remained relatively active compared to previous months. The recent bond auction held in the last week of April’19 witnessed a massive interest as the total participation amounted to PKR 559 billion compared to the target of PKR 100 billion. Majority of the participation was witnessed in 3Y (44%) followed by 5Y (29%) and 10Y (25%) respectively. Out of total bids of PKR 249 billion in 3Y, the central bank only accepted PKR 158 billion at 12.20% (3bps down from the last auction) while rejecting 5Y and 10Y completely.

SBP conducted T-bill auctions twice during the reviewed month. Market participants took aggressive bets in 3 months and a cumulative amount of PKR 4.40 trillion was witnessed in fortnightly auction. Central bank restricted the take up amount to PKR 1.015 trillion, owing to which yields were sharply adjusted downwards by 12-15 bps in the secondary market.

Going forward, with the recent developments in Ministry of finance, central bank and ongoing talks with IMF with regard to the funding requirements and structural changes in economic policy; a decisive policy action will be needed where an increase in DR and change in exchange rate regime cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index closed negative for fourth consecutive month. For May, the index closed 2.2% down at 35,975 points taking 11MFY19 return to -14.16%. Average daily turnover in May 2019 came in at 96.1mn which was similar to previous month’s level of 95.83mn despite shorter trading hours in the month of Ramadan. During May, the net foreign inflow amounted to US$ 18.4mn compared to a net foreign inflow of US$ 2.0mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in commercial banks (US$ 22.5mn), cements (US$12.4mn) and power companies (US$ 3.3mn) while they remained net sellers in Oil and Gas exploration companies (US$ 16.6mn) and fertilizers (US$ 3.4mn).

The index remained under pressure during the month as the rupee weakened further post the IMF deal finalization. With the condition that the primary deficit needs to be contained at 0.6% of GDP, media reports continued to suggest of massive increase in taxes for next year’s budget which kept investors jittery. Further, the 150bps hike in the last half of the month was above market expectations and boded negatively for inflation to come in the next few months.

On a monthly basis, fertilizers contributed the largest to the decline with 301 points followed by oil and gas exploration sector with 152 points after the failure of Kekra well was confirmed. Textiles followed suit contributing 123 points to the decline with the budget likely to withdraw zero-rated status for the sector.

The budget for FY20 will be presented on June 11, 2019 which will be the first budget under the new government and the first one under IMF. This will provide further clarity on how government sees economy progressing for next year.
