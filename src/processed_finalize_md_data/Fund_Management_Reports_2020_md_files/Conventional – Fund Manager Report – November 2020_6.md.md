Fund Managers' Report November 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy continued its sharp recovery in November. Current Account registered a surplus of US$ 382mn for October’20 compared to a deficit of US$ 73 mn in October’19. For 1QY21, the surplus is USD 1160 mn as compared to a deficit of USD 1,420 mn in SPLY. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation. Exports during October ’20 showed decrease of 10% YoY mainly due to decrease in non-textile exports. Foreign remittances depicted surprising increase of 14% YoY for October’20, despite the fact that COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of Expatriates across the globe.

Foreign exchange reserves increased by ~US$ 242 mn during the month to close at US$ 20.2 bn as of 29 November, 2020, mainly due to multilateral inflows and current account stability. PKR appreciated by 0.5% against USD during the month. Expected monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions and inflows through Roshan Pakistan Savings accounts should provide further support to the Rupee in next few months.

CPI clocked in at a level of 8.4% for the month of November’20 which was higher than market consensus. The level of MoM Inflation was witnessed due to increase in food prices amid supply is disruptions. We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months mainly due to a high base effect. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP has kept policy rate unchanged at 7 percent to continue the momentum of economic recovery, while raised its inflation forecasts to 7-9%.

The Government is expecting a contraction of 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has set a GDP Growth target of 2.1% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July-Sep’20 taking relevant index up by 4.8% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul-Sep’2020 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

Short-term risks remain due to the second wave of COVID-19. The number of daily new cases has increased to over 3,000 whereas active cases have increased to more than 50,000 from a low of 6,000 earlier. Therefore, government has imposed restrictions on social gatherings and business timings, although a full-scale lockdown has been ruled out for now. Nevertheless, long-term outlook remains bright for the economy as multiple vaccines have proven to be effective against the virus in trials and a public rollout is on the horizon.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the reviewed month, SBP announced the monetary policy for the next two months. As expected the policy rate was maintained at 7% as the monetary policy committee (MPC) viewed the existing stance is appropriate to support the nascent recovery, while keeping the inflation expectations well anchored and maintaining financial stability. On inflation front, the recent out turns was on the higher side owing to the rise in food inflation; However, SBP termed it as a temporary phenomenon and expected the average inflation for FY 21 would remain in the range of 7-9% respectively.

Secondary market witnessed a range bound activity across all tenors as spike in COVID related cases refrained the majority of institutional investors from taking heavy bets in longer duration instruments. Short term treasury bills were preferred investment avenue for the market participants as the yields adjusted by approximately 3-5 bps since the last auction held in the month of October.

SBP conducted Treasury bill auctions twice during the month. Total cumulative realized amount in both the auctions was PKR 686.17bn. Cut off yields stood at 7.1402%, 7.1959% and 7.2498% for 3, 6 and 12 months tenor respectively.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 15.561 billion against the total participation of PKR 62.011 billion. The cut-off of 3year, 15 year and 20 year tenors stood at 8.24%, 9.98%, 10.5498%, while the amount in 5 and 10 years tenors was rejected.

At present, the spike in COVID cases seems to be manageable as the government is determined to take stringent steps to keep the pandemic situation under control. However, the rising number of cases must be kept under check as it may pose serious concerns in continuing the growth momentum of the economy going forward.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index witnessed yet another volatile month, as the index gained 5.3% in the first 8 trading sessions to a level of 41,197 points. Rising Covid-19 cases coupled with profit taking by investors resulted in a correction by 3.8% in the next 8 trading sessions as the bourse witnessed selling pressure across the board, however, the index closed on a positive note with news circulating about a number of vaccines being tested with positive results during the trials. Hence the bourse closed at 41,068 points (up 2.96% MoM). The average daily turnover declined by 39% on MoM basis as it clocked at 161mn in November, compared to previous month’s level of 266mn. Foreigners remained net sellers this month, as the net foreign outflow during Nov’20 amounted to US$47.19mn as compared to a net outflow of US$39.12mn in Oct’20, where the selling was concentrated in Cements (US$ 15.76mn) and Oil and Gas Exploration companies (US$ 8.77mn).

Key developments during the month included a) Announcement of vaccines against Covid-19 by global pharmaceutical companies including Pfizer and Moderna with efficiency of almost 90% b) Oil prices hit eight months high sparked by the news of effective vaccines, c) Central Bank kept the policy rate unchanged at 7% and d) Current account surplus for fourth consecutive month in October also lifted sentiments as signs of recovery in economic activity continue to appear.

Number of daily coronavirus cases increased to more than 3000 in the latter part of the month of November, higher than 600 to 800 cases in the previous month. Number of cases have increased worldwide since the change in weather. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 343k compared to 315k in the last month, however, active cases more than tripled from 12.5k in the previous month end to 49.1k by end of the month as daily cases outpaced recoveries.

On a monthly basis, Oil and Gas Exploration contributed the most to the index by 525 points, as Crude oil prices hit 8 months high on the news of possible roll out of a number of vaccines against Covid-19, followed by Commercial Banks which contributed 444 points to the index as investors couldn't ignore the attractive valuations on offer. On the contrary, Cements contributed negatively to the index the most by 84 points followed by Oil and Gas Marketing companies with 80 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals, rising Covid-19 infections, the possible rollout of vaccines & its impact on business operations will determine market direction in the near term.
