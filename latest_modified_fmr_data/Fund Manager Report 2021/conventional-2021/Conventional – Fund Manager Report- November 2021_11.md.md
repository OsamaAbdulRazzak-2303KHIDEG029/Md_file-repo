Fund Managers' Report November 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit (CAD) in Oct’21 registered at US$1,663mn as compared to a surplus of US$448mn in same period last year as imports for Oct’21 of US$6.4bn were nearly double to that of last year. Higher imports are mainly attributable to bull-run in commodity cycle globally and one off imports like Covid vaccines, sugar and wheat. Decent growth was witnessed in goods exports and remittances of 24% and 10% respectively, however, was not sufficient to cover large imports in Oct’21.

As per PBS, imports in Nov’ 21 stood at US$7.85bn amid higher commodity prices as consumption around the globe reaching to its pre-pandemic level. Foreign exchange reserves as at end of Nov’21, stood at US$22.5bn from its highest level of US$27.2bn in Aug’21. Higher than expected imports raised concerns on depleting foreign exchange reserves, resultantly PKR/USD parity reached to its historic high level of 175.72 in Nov’21.

On the other hand, SBP raised policy rate by 150 basis points to 8.75% in Nov’21 on account of risks on inflation and balance of payments. The Central Bank noted that global commodity and energy prices, due to disruption in supply chains, have persisted on the higher side longer than expected. Elevated commodity prices (including food and energy) and upward adjustment in power tariffs, caused inflation to stand at 21-month high level of 11.53% in Nov’21.

Large Scale Manufacturing Index growth slowed slightly in the month of Sep as Jul-Sep’21 growth stands at 5.15% relative to 7.26% during Jul-Aug’21. During Sep’21, Food and Non Metallic Mineral Products contributed negatively and declined by 3.17%YoY and 2.53%YoY respectively.

On the positive side, the Government was able to secure deposit of US$3bn and US$1.2bn oil supplies on deferred payment from Saudi Arabia to support dwindling forex reserves. Moreover, recent emergence of COVID’19 variant raised concern on global economic outlook and dragged down energy prices in the month of Nov’21; as Brent oil, coal, natural gas declined by 3%MoM, 36%MoM and 11%MoM respectively.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The month of November was quite volatile in terms of macroeconomic issues. Soaring current account deficit owing to the massive increase in imports, kept the USD at record high levels against the local currency. In addition, the massive rise in global commodity prices resulted in higher than expected inflation as the domestic demand witnessed an upward trend after the recovery from pandemic. The central bank being proactive, gauged the pressure and raised CRR to 6% from 5% in order to control aggregate demand in the system. Subsequently further tightening stance was implemented as the central bank increased the policy rate by 150 bps to 8.75%, sighting risk related to inflation and balance of payment position.

The secondary market yields skewed north, as the uncertainty in the market kept the institutional investors at bay. Yields across all tenors adjusted roughly by 100 to 150 bps during the reviewed month. In the last T-bill auction held on 17th Nov. The auction had a total maturity of PKR 527bn against a target of PKR 600bn. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 515bn. Out of total participation bids worth PKR 276bn were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 105bn in 6 months, and PKR 133bn in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 54bn in 3 months’ tenor at a cut-off yield of 8.5% while rejecting 6 months’ and 12 months’.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on Nov 29th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 150bn. Total participation of PKR 288bn was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10 & 15 tenors received bids worth PKR 85bn, PKR 84bn, PKR 114bn & PKR 4bn respectively. SBP accepted bids worth 25bn in 3 years, 56bn in 05 years & 36bn in 10 years at a cutoff rate of 11.34%, 11.59% & 11.79% respectively. Bids in 15 year’s tenor were rejected. Auction for semi-annual Floating Rate Bond was held on Nov 17th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 50bn. Bids worth PKR 17.25bn and 10.25bn were received in 5 years and 10 years in this auction, SBP rejected all bids. Auction for Quarterly reset floating Rate Bond was held on Nov 17th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 25bn. Bids worth PKR 14.25bn were received in this auction, SBP rejected all the bids.

Auction for fortnightly Reset - Quarterly Payment Coupon floating Rate Bond was held on Nov 17th, 2021 with a total target of PKR 25bn. Bids worth PKR 64bn were received in this auction out of which SBP accepted bids worth PKR 29bn at a cutoff price of 99.3322.

Resumption of IMF program is expected to come up with stringent conditions and government will need to make tough decisions in order to address the fiscal imbalances.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index posted negative return of 2.41% during the month of November to close at 45,072 points. The average daily volume increased by 4.66% on MoM basis as it clocked at 124.6mn compared to previous month’s level of 119mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$141.34mn compared to a net outflow of US$26.92mn in October, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$69.03mn) while there was net buying in Technology amounting to US$4.59mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Pakistani authorities and IMF staff reached staff-level agreement on policies and reforms needed to complete the sixth review; b) Central Bank in the latest meeting held on Nov 19, 2021 raised policy rate by 150bps after 25bps hike in September 2021. High inflation and current account deficit remained key reasons for the hike and c) SBP and Saudi Development Fund sign deposit agreement for US$3bn, moreover, Pakistan to get US$1.2bn worth of deferred oil facility also from KSA.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 37% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases decreased by 37%, and stood at 14.16k at the end of the month, compared to 22.5k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Fertilizer contributed the most to the index i.e. 125 points. On the contrary, Cement contributed negatively to the index the most by 306 points.

Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
