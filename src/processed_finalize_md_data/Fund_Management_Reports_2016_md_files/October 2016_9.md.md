## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI numbers for October rose to highest level since Dec-14 as it clocked in at 4.21% bringing the 4MFY17 average to 3.95% compared to 1.65% in 4MFY16. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has projected a 5% GDP growth rate for Pakistan for the current fiscal year. This growth rate is the same as that projected by World Bank and slightly lower than Asian Development Bank's projection of 5.2%. The international credit‐rating organization "Standard and Poor's" improved Pakistan's long‐term credit rating from B‐Negative to 'B' with stable outlook at October end. In its report Standard and Poor acclaimed Pakistan's continuous improvement in governance under the current government. On the external side, challenges remain with 1QFY17 current account deficit increasing by 1.4x YoY to USD1.37bn due to weakness in exports (-5%) and rising machinery related imports (+1%) more than compensating lower oil import bill. Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) growth for Aug-2016 remained 1.5% YoY in which major contributors were Iron & Steel, Pharmaceuticals, Automobile, Fertilizer and Rubber Products sector, (Aug-2015 growth was 7% YoY). Furthermore additional accumulation of foreign reserves to USD 24.3bn with the issuance of USD 1bn sukuk in international markets at record low interest rate level of 5.5% is expected to provide support to currency in near term. Slowdown in remittances growth (-5% in 1QFY17) is due to a decline in oil prices which remains a potent risk to external account going forward.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the month of October Government bond yields increased significantly as low interest environment was expected to bottom out. The continuously rising inflationary trend coupled with expected devaluation of PKR against the greenback triggered the financial institutions to book gains and with little demand to match the selling pressure the bond yields increase by 05 - 20 bps across various tenors where longer term bonds bore the major brunt. The participation of the PIB auction of 19th Oct’2016 equaled PKR 72 billion out of which 3 years PIB received bids worth of PKR 62 billion, 5 years PIB received PKR 10 billion and 10 years PIB received only PKR 2 billion of bids. The insignificant amount as well as higher yields resulted in the auction being rejected. The yields for latest 3 year PIB rose as high as 6.28% and PIBs for 5, 6, and 10 years also came under pressure with their trades witnessed as high as approx. 6.86%, 7.10%, and 7.96% respectively. The results of the latest T-bill auction of 26thOct’ 16 were 3M 5.9017%, while the cut offs for 6M, and 12M were maintained at 5.9046%, and 5.9148% respectively. The target amount set for the auction was PKR 200 billion out of which only PKR 90 billion was accepted. T-bill auction held on 12th Oct’ 16 were 3M 5.8571%, while the cut offs for 6M and 12M were maintained at 5.9046% and 5.9148% respectively. The target amount set for the auction was PKR 200 billion out of which only PKR 65 billion was accepted.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 remained under pressure this month as expectations of political tumult reduced investor confidence. The market showed a correction of 1.6% on an MTD basis however noteworthy is the approx. 4% dip that it witnessed from its peak of 41,564 points to 39,894 points during the month of October. Volumes of KSE-100 index remained flat MoM in October to 174 mn while value traded rose by a higher 20% MoM to PKR 9.6bn. Quarterly earning record on the other hand also depicted mixed momentum with earnings of index heavy weight sectors including Banks (top and mid-tier) and Oil declining by 6% and 3% YoY respectively while earnings of cements improved 5% YoY. The profitability of fertilizer sector improved by 46% YoY, on the back of improved offtake. The outgoing month contained several corporate announcements & developments that included;(i) Abraaj agreeing to divest its stake in KE to Shanghai Electric, (ii) possible scale back of HUBC’s coal power plant, (iii) LUCK proceeding ahead on its coal power project with modifications in local/imported coal mix and (iv) SHC’s ruling in favor of ENGRO against GIDC Act 2015. Individuals (-USD49mn) dominated the selling spree while institutional investors that included NBFC (USD24.6mn) and Mutual Funds (USD31.7mn) provided support to the index. Top performing scrip’s were NESTLE (+6.58%), SNGP (+21.79%), HBL (+1.3%), BOP (+17.19%), PMPK (+29.9%) and UBL (+1.36%) contributed 237 points cumulatively to the index. However, the weightage of decliners were more during the month that included HUBC (-10.44%), PPL (-9.23%), KAPCO (-11.79%), DGKC (-7.65%), TRG (15.69%), MCB (-3.34%) and ENGRO (-4.16%) which dragged the index down and took away 656 points cumulatively. Sector wise return shows that Multiutilities, Software & Textile sector gained the most among the key sectors, while Telecom, Electricity and Cement declined by the most in the outgoing month in terms of market cap change.
