Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report July 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

For the month of June’21, Current Account Deficit (CAD) clocked in at US$1,644mn compared to a deficit of US$121mn in same period last year. Increase in imports of goods by 78% on YoY basis outpaced exports growth, resulting in 93% rise in trade deficit compared to same period last year. Current account balance for the current fiscal ended with a deficit of US$1.85bn compared to a deficit of US$4.45bn in the comparable period last year. Main reason for the decrease is the extraordinary rise in workers remittances that have averaged approximately US$2.45bn a month, 27% higher compared to last year.

Forex reserves stood at US$24.85bn, increasing by US$456mn compared to end of last month. PKR extended its weakening against the greenback this month, as PKR depreciation for the month stood at 3% to close at PKR162.32. On an overall basis in FY21, PKR has gained 3.46% from PKR 168 in June 2020. Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) dropped from 102.2 in May to 99.85 in June and is expected to go further down in July as PKR depreciated this month by 3%. We expect PKR to depreciate by 3-4% on annual basis and expect the REER to remain slightly below 100.

CPI stood at 8.4% in July, compared to 9.7%YoY in June 2021. This was mainly because of a higher base as perishable food prices remained abnormally high last year at this time. Moving ahead, increase in international oil prices, surge in overall aggregate demand, and any power and gas tariff hikes if declared are key risks to the Government’s target inflation of 8.2% in the next year.

The Government announced provisional GDP growth number of 3.94% for FY2021. LSM Growth posted growth of 37% in the month of May because of low base in last year due to Covid-19. For 11MFY21, LSM has depicted growth of 15% YoY. This entails a very swift V-shaped recovery in economy compared to last year.

Government’s vaccination drive has stepped up very well, as fully vaccinated personnel registered growth of 115% compared to last month and currently stand at 7.24mn i.e. 3.5% of the total population, while partially vaccinated total currently stands at 28.07mn, so a swift increase is expected in vaccinated personnel in the coming months as well. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases increased by 120%, and stood at 69.7k at the end of the month, compared to 31.7 at end of last month. The positivity ratio in the new tests conducted climbed to 7.7%.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

SBP announced the monetary policy for the next two months in July. As expected the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) continued its accommodative stance and maintained the policy rate at 7.00%. The MPC was of the view that the uncertainty created by the on-going fourth COVID in the country should be emphasized through accommodative stance in order to support the nascent recovery in the economy. On inflation front, it is expected that the average should fall in the range of 7-9 % during the year. However, over the last couple of months average CPI remained at the higher side owing to the rebound in global commodity prices and uptick in domestic demand.

State Bank of Pakistan conducted a Treasury bill auction twice during the month. The total amount matured during the month was PKR 837 billion against a target of PKR 1400 billion. In the last T-bill Auction, total participation witnessed was around PKR 1.5 trillion. Out of total participation bids worth, PKR 594 billion were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 859 billion in 6 months, and PKR 107 billion in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 647 billion in a breakup of PKR 163 billion, and PKR 484 billion. The cut-off yields of 3/6 months tenors in last T-bill auction were 7.2401% and 7.5185%, while the bid in 12 months were rejected.

In a PIB auction conducted during the month, total target was PKR 125 billion. Total participation of PKR 309 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10, 15 year tenor received bids worth PKR 218 billion, PKR 48 billion, PKR 35 billion, PKR 7 billion respectively. State bank of Pakistan accepted PKR 85 billion in 3 years, PKR 76 billion in 5 years, PKR 18 billion in 10 years, PKR 15 billion in 15 years, and 10 billion at a Cut‐off rate of 8.69%, 9.19%, 9.8390% and 10.40% respectively.

Going forward, as indicated in last monetary policy statement, the policy to remain largely accommodative in the near term and a gradual adjustment will be made in order to achieve the mildly positive real rate once the economy returns to operate at its full capacity. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index remained in negative returns territory for second month in a row to close at 47,055 points, as negative return for the month stood at 0.64%. The average daily turnover decreased by a whopping 53% on MoM basis as it clocked at 147mn compared to previous month’s level of 310mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$28.6mn as compared to a net outflow of US$31.86mn in June, where the selling was concentrated in Food and Personal Care products (US$2.4mn) while there was net buying in Cements amounting to US$2.41mn.

Key developments during the month include a) SBP maintained their accommodative stance in Monetary policy meeting as achieving growth in economy remains the primary target, however gradual adjustment can be made in future if pressure on CAD and inflation primarily from demand side persists; b) Complete lockdown imposed in Karachi in order to control outspread of Covid-19; c) CAD widened to US$1.6bn for the month of June, causing concerns of high CAD in next fiscal year and simultaneous deterioration in economic indicators and d) Auto financing hits record high as new auto policy launched by the government started bearing fruits. Number of daily covid-19 cases for July started in the range of 1-2k but ended close to 5k as 4th wave continued to grapple domestically and globally as well. National infection ratio climbed to 7.7%. Recovered patients as at month end stood at 942k compared to 904k in the last month. Further, total number of active cases increased to 69.7k at month end compared to 31.7k in previous month end.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 200 points, followed by Chemical sector which contributed 93 points to the index mainly due to expectation of dividend and decent profitability in the upcoming results season. On the contrary, Oil and Gas Exploration contributed negatively to the index the most by 147 points.

Negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs and revenue collection, macroeconomic fundamentals, and Covid-19 infections will determine market direction in the near term.
