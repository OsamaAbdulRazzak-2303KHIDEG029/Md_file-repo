Fund Managers' Report June 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing data continues to disappoint as the 10MFY19 relevant index is down by 3.5% YoY. The contraction was seen across all sectors with food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, iron and steel products and autos leading the decline. Inflation for the month of Jun’19 clocked in at 8.89% which was lower than estimates primarily due to decline in food prices after Ramadan. Rupee remained volatile, and further depreciated by 10.4% during the month before appreciating by 2.4% to close at PKR 160/USD.

Pakistan seems to be in low GDP growth phase where FY19 GDP growth is estimated to hover around 3.3%, but will fall further in FY20 at 2.4%. Fiscal position remained worrisome with overall foreign exchange reserves as of June 28, 2019 standing at US$ 14.4bn. The reserves will witness a spike going forward owing to a USD 6bn bailout, and lending from other development institutions that will follow the bailout. Current Account deficit for the month of May’19 came in at US$ 1.1bn, lower by USD 155mn as compared to Apr’19. For 11MFY19, CAD stands at US$ 11.9bn, down from US$ 16.3bn in the same period last year, showing a decline of a hefty 27%. The situation is precarious since the import cover has fallen to below 2 months. However, given the austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation, coupled with the Saudi Oil facility starting from July, the worst seems to be behind us, with further improvement expected in the current account. Exports during the first eleven months remained flattish and clocked in at USD 21.3bn. The trade deficit in 11MFY19 stood at US$ 25.4bn, showing a decline of 8.3%, while remittances went up by 11.4% to clock in at USD 20.2bn.

During the month, Pakistan finalized a US$ 6bn Extended Fund Facility (EFF) from IMF for 3 years. Under the program, Pakistan needs to contain primary deficit at 0.6% of GDP while a market-determined exchange rate will be implemented to support the financial sector and better resource allocation within the country. The government announced its first budget for FY20 aiming for increased revenue and encouraging people to file returns by strictly penalizing non-filers.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of June, CPI clocked in at 8.89% down from 9.1% in May 2019. The decline in inflation was attributable to slow down in food prices during the month. Money market remained fairly illiquid, despite multiple injections from the central bank (i.e. 8 times) through open market operations (OMOs). Approximately PKR 3.39 trillion was injected in the system during the period under review. Owing to the stringent liquidity conditions, interbank money market lending hovered around 12.65%-12.85% respectively.

Central Bank conducted T-bill auctions twice during the month. Despite a heavy target of PKR 500 Billion in each auction, market participated merely around PKR 114 Billion and PKR 27 Billion in 3 months, while no interest was witnessed in 6-12 months tenor. T-bill cut-offs were maintained at 12.74% respectively.

Contrary to the T-bills, participation in the longer duration instruments witnessed an overwhelming response. The auction had a target of PKR 100 Billion against which a total participation of PKR 241.1 Billion was witnessed. Participation this time around was majorly skewed towards longer tenure 53% in 10-Year, 34% in 5-Year and 17% in 3-Year. The central bank accepted PKR 2.2 Billion, PKR 27 Billion and PKR 89.1 Billion in 3, 5 and 10 year at the cutoff rate of 13.69%, 13.80% and 13.70% respectively.

Heavy tax targets by the incumbent government in FY20 budget coupled with weakening of PKR against USD will further escalate inflationary pressure in the economy. Going forward, in order to curb the inflationary pressure another round of increase in the discount rate by the central bank cannot be ruled out.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index closed negative for fifth consecutive month in June. The index closed 5.8% down at 33,902 points taking FY19 return to -19.1%. Average daily turnover June 2019 came in at 98.8mn which was similar to previous month’s level of 96.1mn despite shorter trading hours in the month of Ramadan. During May, the net foreign outflow amounted to US$ 4.9mn compared to a net foreign inflow of US$ 18.4mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in commercial banks (US$ 8.3mn) and cements (US$ 3.1mn) while they remained net sellers in Oil and Gas exploration companies (US$ 15.5mn) and fertilizers (US$ 3.4mn).

The index remained under pressure during the month as concerns regarding weakening economy and persistent current account deficit weighed down on the investor sentiments. The government announced its first budget for FY20 with the central theme of increase in tax collection (a record target of PKR 5.5tn has been set), discouraging the informal economy and reducing public expenditure. Therefore, it is anticipated that economic growth will likely slow down in the upcoming year which further dampened investor sentiment for equities investments.

On a monthly basis, commercial banks contributed the largest to the decline with 675 points followed by oil and gas exploration sector with 447 points amid heavy foreign selling. Oil and Gas Marketing Companies followed suit contributing 123 points to the decline due to shrinking industry volumes. Going forward, IMF board is expected to ratify the Extended Finance Facility worth $6.2bn in July which can encourage foreign inflows due to exchange rate stability and improve local investor sentiments as well.
