## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

FY17 fiscal deficit stands at PKR 1.86 trillion at 5.8% of GDP compared to the government’s target of 4.2% of GDP. The fiscal deficit is at the highest in the last 4 years and adds complication to the country’s macroeconomic troubles. Pakistan’s consolidated revenues improved by 11% to PKR 4.9 trillion (15.5% of GDP), on the back of higher mark-up collections from Public Sector Enterprises. However, tax collection rose by 8.4% to PKR 3.97 trillion (12.5% of GDP), mainly because of relatively stagnant Sales Tax collection. The development spending by provinces increased by 44% YoY, thereby pulling aggregate provincial budget balance into a substantial deficit of PKR 163 bn or 0.5% of GDP, after 4 years of surpluses. The development spending by provinces is likely to remain higher in FY18 owing to looming general elections, which may continue to drag consolidated fiscal performance. The Provincial surplus stood at PKR 137 bn in 9MFY17, which implies that provinces ran a net deficit of PKR 300 bn in 4QFY17 to turn the surplus into PKR 163 bn deficit for FY17. The widening twin deficits coupled with rapid private sector credit expansion, reaching 9-year high of 19% in July-17 is further hurting the overall economy. Overvalued currency, as indicated by persistently elevated REER, is fuelling imports while hurting exports. Foreign reserves are constantly under pressure and strict policy actions along with structural reforms are crucial to sustaining macroeconomic stability achieved over the past 4 years. Investments have remained concentrated towards addressing domestic demand and in future proper strategic plans are needed to encourage exports oriented investments. According to the latest data of PBS inflation for the month of Aug-17 clocked in at 3.4% YoY. The surge in inflation was attributable to low base effect from dip in general price levels last year. Among the individual CPI components, food inflation was the main driver of CPI general inflation. Going forward the inflation is expected to remain subdued at least till December which implies that there’s imminent upward pressure on the Discount and Policy rate.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period, yield curve shifted slightly upwards mainly due to economic uncertainty i.e. widening trade gap, worsening of current account deficit and a wide fiscal deficit along with a perceived inflated currency. Throughout the month the activity in bond market remained relatively muted. Shorter tenure T-bills remained highly preferred avenue for the market participants. During the month, participation in T-bill auction remained resilient, with the central bank able to raise approx. 1.7 trillion against the target of 1.5 trillion at the previous cutoff of 5.99% (3 months), 6.01% (6 months) and 6.04% (12 months). A similar pattern of participation was witnessed again in the T-bill auction with majority of participation was witnessed in 3 months followed by 6 months and 12 months respectively. The participation in PIB auction reinforced the position of market participants as the total participation equaled to a meager total of PKR 26 billion and due to insignificant amount at previous cutoff levels the bids in the bond auction were rejection.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

During the month of August 2017 the market remained extremely volatile and was down 10.44% MoM. The outcome of PM Nawaz’s disqualification in Panama issue had remained a sentiment dampener for the market. The new PM, Mr. Shahid Khaqan Abbasi along with his elected cabinet has taken up charge; however swift and positive actions towards controlling a slipping economy are still required on the government’s end to calm investors’ nerves and indicate a clearer direction in near future. The biggest concern for investors at the moment are on the economic front, although the PKR/USD has remained stable around 105.5 but this level is widely believed to be unrealistic and the market participants expect the PKR to depreciate by 5% - 7% against the greenback. The current account has widened (USD 2.05bn in July-2017 vs USD 662mn in SPLY), and more importantly there was little support from financial account. Additionally, the flattish corporate result season has further dampened the investors’ confidence and forced the PSX in a downward direction in the absence of any other visible triggers to drive a bullish momentum.

The KSE-100 average traded volume in August 2017 clocked in at 92.8 mn shares as compared to 87 mn shares in July 2017. Foreigners were net sellers of USD 80.5mn in Aug 2017 as compared to net selling of USD 38mn in July 2017. Looking at the Sector wise break-up, Life insurance, Pharma and cements were worst performers underperforming the index by 7.2%, 6.7%, and 5.5% respectively, whereas Software & Telecom and Textiles were top performers beating KSE-100 by 8.6%, 7.1%, and 7.1% respectively, on the back of investors considering PKR/USD depreciation.
