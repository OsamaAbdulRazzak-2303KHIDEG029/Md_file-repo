Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report May 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

In the first ten months of FY24, the Current Account reported a deficit of US$202 million, a dramatic improvement from the US$3.92 billion deficit during the same period last year, marking a 95% decrease. April 2024 saw a Current Account surplus of US$491 million, up from US$134 million in April 2023. This improvement was primarily driven by a 28% YoY increase in remittances mainly attributed to a stable exchange rate and increased use of formal channels.

Foreign exchange reserves experienced an increase of 6.75% to US$14.216 billion by May 31, 2024, compared to US$13.316 billion at the end of April 2024. The Pakistani Rupee (PKR) remained relatively stable, averaging 278.2 in May. Inflation fell to 11.8% in May, down from 17.3% in April, moving real interest rates into positive territory. The primary driver of this decline includes food, housing and transport segment, major declined witnessed in different items on MoM basis such as chicken, vegetables, wheat, and petroleum prices due to price normalization after Ramadan uptick and bumper crops in FY24, Coupled with higher base effect and currency stabilization supported by favorable macroeconomic indicators.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at a lower level. Monetary easing is anticipated to begin in the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting i.e. June 10, 2024. The real interest rate is currently an impressive 10.3%, significantly higher than the historical median of 1%. This substantial difference is expected to support monetary easing in the near future potentially reducing the policy rate by 6%-8% over the next fiscal year. However, risks remain from potential inflationary reforms implemented under the budget and IMF program and volatility in exchange rate and oil prices.

The new government has demonstrated a clear commitment to economic reforms, successfully concluding the second review of the current Stand-By Agreement (SBA), leading to an immediate disbursement of USD 1.1 billion.

Talks are ongoing for a more extensive assistance package with the IMF. Whereas, IMF mission is expected to visit Pakistan after federal budget to finalize details of a USD 6-8 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) program. Pakistan's upcoming Federal Budget for FY25, scheduled for June 12th, 2024, is poised to set the foundation for what could be the country's largest IMF program to date. This budget will act as a comprehensive plan for the forthcoming extended IMF program, heavily influenced by IMF recommendations. The anticipated new IMF program is expected to establish a framework for financial support from multilateral agencies, crucial for addressing the external account challenges projected for the next three years, especially with substantial debt repayments looming.

On a positive note, the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) platform is expected to attract significant investments from Saudi Arabia, China, and the UAE over the next 2-5 years.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of May clocked in at 11.8% which declined significantly compared to April 2024. Food segment remained the major contributor to decrease in monthly change, while other segments also remained on declining trend as well on MoM basis. Overall, CPI also witnessed declining trend on MoM basis. Major declined witnessed in food items on MoM basis such as chicken and wheats due to price normalization after Ramadan uptick and bumper crops in FY24. Overall, Year-on-Year inflation hit a 23-month low marking the instance of positive real interest rate since December 2020 and open room for SBP to cut interest rate going forward.

Recent monetary policy held at end of April in which SBP maintained the policy rate at 22%. Secondary market yield witnessed declining trend and overall decreased by an average of 82bps while longer tenor yields declined by around 4bps during the month. The yields witnessed declining trend prior to monetary policy announcements as market started pricing in increase expectation of interest rate cuts due to positive indicators such as considerable improvement in both inflation readings and external position.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions with a target of PKR 810 billion against the maturity of PKR 730 billion. In the first auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 578 billion at a cut-off yield of 21.60%, 21.29% and 20.41% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the Second auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 445 billion at a cut-off yield of 21.00%, 21.00%, and 20.10% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the PIB auction, bids worth Rs. 97 billion were accepted for 3-year, 5-year, and 10-year tenures at cut-off yields of 16.65%, 15.45%, and 14.30% respectively. However, no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years & 30-years tenures.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent elevated levels and remained below 15% on a consistent basis due to stability in currency along with favorable base effect. Monetary easing is expected to begin in upcoming Monetary policy scheduled on 10-June-2024, potentially resulting in a reduction of 6%-8% in the policy rate over the next Fiscal year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program, volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict remain significant risk to our forecasted rate cuts this extent.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

In May 2024, the benchmark index KSE-100 Index reached new heights, surpassing the 75,000 level by the end of the month. The index continued its impressive performance and closed at a level of 75,878 points resulting in a robust return of 6.7% as improved macro-economic indicators led to positive investor sentiment. Average daily volume declined by 3% on monthly basis as it clocked at 236.4mn compared to previous month’s level of 243.5mn.

Foreign investors once again remained prominent, with a net foreign inflow of US$15.85 million, compared to last month inflow of US $48.21 million. Foreign buying was predominantly concentrated in Commercial Banks, Fertilizer and in Oil and Gas Exploration sectors. Moreover, Commercial Banks emerged as the top performing sectors during the month, contributing 1,562 points, whereas Power Generation and Cement contributed 782 & 437 points respectively.

Major events that occurred during the month include; a) Commencement of talks with the IMF for a fresh loan program after successful conclusion of a short-term USD 3 billion Stand-By Arrangement (SBA); b) visit to Islamabad from executives of Saudi Arabia to discuss purchasing a stake in Pakistan’s Reko Diq gold and copper mine; c) strong investor interest in equities prompted corporations to raise capital through the capital markets as IPOs from Fast Cables, International Packaging Films Limited, and TPL REIT Fund I all were oversubscribed; and d) Inflation for the month of April stood at 17.3%, marking a notable decline compared to March 2024's reported inflation of 20.70%, moreover, persistent decline in SPI readings made expectation of CPI to be lower than 13% for the month of May 2024 and a possible rate cut in June’s monetary policy meeting.

The new government's strong commitment to economic reforms, adherence to the IMF program, and focus on fiscal consolidation have instilled confidence among investors in both the economy and the stock market. We believe, realization of massive investments from friendly countries and commencement of monetary easing can potentially spark another rally in the market. Furthermore, valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of 3.4x compared to 10 years average of 7x.
