Fund Managers' Report March 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

In the first eight months of FY24, the Current Account recorded a deficit of US$999 mn, showcasing a substantial improvement from the deficit of US$3.84 bn during the same period last year, marking a 74% decrease. In February 2024, the Current Account reported a surplus of US$128 mn, compared to a deficit of US$50 mn during the same period last year. The improvement in CAD can be attributed to a 9% year-on-year decline in imports, totaling $34 bn for the 8MFY24 period, and a 10% year-on-year increase in exports, amounting to $20.5 bn, resulting in a 28% year-on-year decline in trade deficit. Remittances for the first eight months of FY24 have experienced a 1% decline compared to the same period last year.

Foreign exchange reserves saw a slight increase to US$13.42 bn by March 22, 2024, compared to US$13.03 bn at the end of February 2024. The Pakistani Rupee (PKR) has remained relatively stable, averaging at 278.6 for the month of March.

Inflation for the month of March stood at 20.68%, marking a notable decline compared to February 2024's reported inflation of 23.06%, taking real interest rates into positive trajectory. This decrease can be primarily attributed to the higher base effect.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent elevated levels. Monetary easing is expected to begin in the second half of the current fiscal year, potentially resulting in a reduction of 7%-9% in the policy rate over the next year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program remain significant risk to the forecasted rate cuts.

The new government has demonstrated a clear focus on economic reforms and aims to successfully conclude the current Stand-By Agreement. Talks are underway for a fresh IMF program once the SBA expires in March 2024. Moreover, the anticipated new IMF program is expected to establish a framework for financial support from multilateral agencies. This support will be instrumental in addressing the external account challenges that the country is projected to encounter in the next three years, particularly due to substantial debt repayments.

On a positive note, the SIFC platform is anticipated to attract significant investments from Saudi Arabia, China, and the UAE over the next 2-5 years. This has the potential to be a substantial positive development for the country, especially if agreements related to these investments are signed in the near future.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of March clocked in at 20.7% which declined significantly compared to February 2024. Food segment remained the major contributor to increase in monthly change amid the seasonal uptick mainly due to Ramadan, while other segments remained flat on MoM basis. Some perishable food prices including tomatoes and onions witnessed uptick on MoM basis, however, they are expected to stabilize in the near future due to bumper crops in FY24. Overall, Year-on-Year inflation hit a 22-month low marking the first instance of positive real interest rate since December 2020.

Going forward, inflation is expected to decline below 20% on a consistent basis probably from July and onwards. However, the impact of volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict and concerns over upcoming reform actions remain major threats and can mitigate the impact of high base. The same has also been reflected in shorter duration secondary market yields, which have surged by approximately 125bps in second half of this month as SBP also maintained status quo in the monetary policy held on March 18, 2024.

SBP held T-Bill auctions on March 18, 2024, with a target of PKR 340 billion against the maturity of PKR 369 billion. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 744.8 billion in 3 months, PKR 78.4 billion in 6 months and PKR 147.9 billion in 12 months’ tenors at a cut-off yield of 21.66%, 20.39% and 20.90% respectively. In the PIB auction, bids worth Rs. 42.9 billion were accepted in 3-years, PKR 11.8 billion in 5 Years and PKR 1.2 billion in 10 Years at cut-off yields of 16.78%, 15.49% and 14.35%, respectively. However, no bids were received for 15-years, 20-years & 30-years tenures.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent elevated levels. Monetary easing is expected to begin in the second half of the current fiscal year, potentially resulting in a reduction of 7%-9% in the policy rate over the next year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program remain significant risk to the forecasted rate cuts.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Continuing its upward trajectory, the Benchmark index reached record high levels of 67,000 on 28th March 2024, closing the month with the index reaching a level of 67,005, marking a return of 3.8% for the month of March 2024. The market maintained a positive outlook due to the new government's economic reforms, lower inflation figures, unchanged policy rate, and a favorable stance towards the IMF program. Average daily volume experienced a 14% decline on a monthly basis, clocking at 163.9 million compared to the previous month's average level of 190.5 million.

Foreign investors once again remained prominent, with a net foreign inflow of US$15.3 million, compared to last month inflow of US$25.7 million. Foreign buying was predominantly concentrated in Commercial Banks, and Cement sector. Moreover, Commercial Banks emerged as the top performing sectors during the month, contributing 844 points, whereas Cement sector negatively contributed 70 points during the month.

The new government's dedication towards economic reforms, commitment to the IMF program, and focus on fiscal consolidation have bolstered investor confidence in the overall economy and stock market. This positive sentiment is reflected in the rise in foreign inflows in both T-bills and the stock market as the month of March 2024 marked highest inflows in T-bills in last 4 years. Furthermore, the softening of CPI numbers, leading to positive real interest rates, has also contributed to the market's positive outlook.

Going forward, inflation is expected to soften a bit from its high levels due to higher base effect and is expected to fall below 18% from July and onwards. However, the uncertain impact of increased utility tariffs and international oil prices may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

We believe, realization of massive investments from friendly countries and commencement of monetary easing can potentially spark a decent rally in the market. Moreover, valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of 4.9x compared to long term average of 8x.
