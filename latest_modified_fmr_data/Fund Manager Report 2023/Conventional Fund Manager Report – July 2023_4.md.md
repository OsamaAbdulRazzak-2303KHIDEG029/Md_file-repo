Fund Managers' Report July 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

Inflation for the month of July clocked higher than street consensus at 28.3%, mainly due to higher than expected increase in electricity charges. However, inflation came down from 29.4% in June, due to high base effect. Going forward, inflation is expected to continue to fall in the coming months because of a high base, albeit, at elevated levels of mid 20s till January 2023, before falling below 20% in latter half of the year. However, the impact of budgetary taxes and increase in utility tariffs may result in higher than expected inflation as manufacturers start to pass on the impact of cost pressures.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Foreign exchange reserves increased to US$13.5bn at end of July, compared to US$9.2bn at the end of last month, mainly because of receipt of 1st tranche of SBA from IMF, along with funds received from friendly countries including Saudi Arabia and UAE. PKR remained relatively stable during the month and closed at 286.64, depreciating by mere 0.23% against the greenback during July.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The Central Bank conducted a monetary policy meeting on July 31, 2023, in which the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at 22%, citing downward trajectory of inflation going forward, implying a significant level of positive real interest rates. The MPC expects inflation to remain on a lower side in second half of the year due to subdued demand and high base, however, it will continue to remain vigilant and assess its stance to achieve price stability.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions during the month of July, with a target of PKR 1,800 billion against the maturity of PKR 1,243 billion. In the first auction, amount of PKR 597 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.80%, 22.96% and 22.99% for 3-month, 6-month and 12 months’ tenure. In the second auction, an amount of around PKR 584 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.98%, 22.92% and 23.00% for 3 months, 6 months and 12 months’ tenures.

In the PIB auction, bids amounting to PKR 106 billion were realized for 3-years at a cut-off yield of 19.35%, whereas bids for 5-years and 10 years were rejected. No bids were received for 15 years, 20 years and 30 years’ tenures.

Keeping real interest rates in positive territory on forward looking basis remains key objective of the Monetary Policy Committee, as it will continue to remain vigilant and assess its stance to achieve price stability.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a massive return of 15.88% during the month of July to close at a level of 48,035 points, which was last witnessed on August 23, 2021. The average daily volume increased by 135% on MoM basis as it clocked at 186.4mn compared to previous month’s level of 79.4mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$18.15mn compared to a net inflow of US$6.26mn in May, where the buying was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$10.67mn) while there was net selling in Power generation amounting to US$0.92mn. On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 2,798 points. On the contrary, Investment companies contributed negatively to the index the most by 29 points.

Signing of Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) with IMF on June 28, 2023 started rally on the bourse as benchmark index witnessed highest ever points increase of 2,446 points in a single day. SBA was accompanied with bilateral flows from Saudi Arabia and UAE which lifted Pakistani forex reserves along with investors’ confidence on the bourse, clearly reflected by 135% increase in average daily volume. Extraordinary results delivered from companies in the Banking sector and intention by the Government to resolve the circular debt problem by increase in utility prices and clearance of historic trade debt kept Banks, E&Ps, OMCs in limelight.

Going forward, inflation is expected to continue to fall in the coming months because of a high base, albeit, at elevated levels of mid 20s till January 2023, before falling below 20% in latter half of the fiscal year 2024. MPC maintained the policy rate at 22% in July meeting, signaling peaking of the interest rate cycle, considering if there aren’t any unforeseen events which result in higher than expected inflation.

We believe, the approval of SBA by the IMF board in July is a significant positive development for the Equity market. Sectors like E&Ps, Power Generation and Oil & Gas Marketing Companies can benefit from the expected hike in utility tariffs. Moreover, expectations of commencement of monetary easing from latter half of fiscal year 2024 can potentially spark another decent rally in the market. Valuation continues to remain enticing as the benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 is currently trading at a PER of ~4x compared to long term average of close to 8x.
