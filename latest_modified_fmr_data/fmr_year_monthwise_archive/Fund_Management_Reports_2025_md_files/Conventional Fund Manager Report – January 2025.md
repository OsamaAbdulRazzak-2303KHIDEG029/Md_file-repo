Alfalah Asset Management Limited (formerly Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited) Fund Managers' Report January 2025

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

In January 2025, Pakistan's export performance showed a notable 4.6% growth compared to the same month last year, amounting to USD 2.92 billion. However, imports surged by 10.0%, reaching USD 5.23 billion. This resulted in a 17.8% expansion of the trade deficit, which climbed to USD 2.31 billion. Despite the rising trade deficit, remittances are expected to remain robust, helping stabilize the current account balance for the month.

For the first half of fiscal year (FY) 2025, the cumulative current account surplus stood at USD 1.21 billion, placing Pakistan on track to achieve its first full-year current account surplus since FY11. At the same time, foreign exchange reserves held by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) experienced a slight dip, decreasing by USD 300 million to USD 11.7 billion, as the country used some of its reserves to settle foreign debt obligations.

Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), decreased sharply in January 2025, reaching 2.4% — down from 4.1% in December 2024. This decline was mainly driven by a base effect, and it represents the lowest inflation rate recorded since October 2015. Furthermore, core inflation continued its downward trend, registering at 8.8%, the lowest level in over two and a half years, compared to 9.1% in the prior month.

Looking ahead, inflation is expected to remain low in the single digits for the next few months, though there could be a slight rise towards the end of the fiscal year. For the full FY25, we project an average CPI of around 5.9%, a significant drop from the 18.9% recorded in FY24.

On the fiscal side, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) reported a 26.3% year-on-year increase in tax collections during the first seven months of FY25, reaching a total of PKR 6,497 billion. However, despite this growth, tax revenues fell short of the target by PKR 468 billion, indicating some challenges in meeting fiscal goals for the year.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month, short-term secondary market yields saw a reduction of 33 basis points (bps), while longer-term yields decreased by 27 bps. These declines in yields followed the State Bank of Pakistan's (SBP) decision to cut the policy rate by 100 bps to 12.0% during the monetary policy meeting held on January 27, 2025, which aligned with market expectations. On January 22, 2025, SBP conducted a Treasury bill auction with a total maturity amount of PKR 341 billion, falling short of the target of PKR 600 billion. In this auction, SBP accepted bids totaling PKR 40 billion in 3-month tenors, PKR 32 billion in 6-month tenors, and PKR 226 billion in 12-month tenors, with cut-off yields of 11.59%, 11.40%, and 11.39%, respectively.

Additionally, on January 15, 2025, SBP held an auction for fixed coupon Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) with a target of PKR 300 billion. In this auction, SBP accepted bids amounting to PKR 190 billion for 2-year bonds, PKR 94 billion for 3-year bonds, PKR 120 billion for 5-year bonds, and PKR 18 billion for 10-year bonds, with cut-off rates of 11.95%, 11.89%, 12.40%, and 12.80%, respectively.

Looking ahead, the outlook for inflation remains positive, supported by currency stability and favorable base effects, which should keep inflation in low single digits in the coming months, with a slight uptick expected toward the end of the fiscal year. Since June 2024, the SBP has implemented a cumulative 1,000 bps reduction in interest rates, bringing them down from 22.0% to the current 12.0%.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After a remarkable 84% rally in CY24, the KSE-100 index started the new calendar year on a subdued note, experiencing a decline of 871 points (-0.8% month-on-month) in January 2025, closing the month at 114,255. Initially, the index surged to a new all-time high of 117,587, but this momentum was short-lived due to higher-than-expected import figures and a revenue shortfall from the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR). However, the market found support through the announcement of a USD 2 billion deposit rollover by the UAE and a USD 20 billion long-term lending package by the World Bank, which helped cushion the losses.

Market activity remained relatively weak during the month, with the average traded volume falling by 46% month-on-month to 679 million shares, while the average traded value dropped by 38% to USD 119 million. On the capital flows front, foreign investors were net sellers, recording a net outflow of USD 15 million. Domestic investors also exhibited a cautious sentiment, with banks and mutual funds emerging as net sellers, offloading USD 28 million and USD 12 million, respectively. Conversely, individual investors and companies were active buyers, registering net inflows of USD 24.8 million and USD 21.3 million, respectively.

Sector-wise, the energy & power (E&Ps), oil marketing companies (OMCs), and technology sectors negatively impacted the market, contributing declines of 1,904, 786, and 386 points, respectively. On the positive side, the fertilizer, banking, and automotive sectors supported the market, collectively contributing 2,604 points to the index.

Looking ahead, market participants will closely track macroeconomic indicators and monitor the government's efforts to meet the conditions of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) ahead of the upcoming IMF review in March 2025. Local and geopolitical developments, along with the SBP's stance on monetary policy, will also be key factors influencing market movements. Despite the recent pullback, we maintain a strong outlook for the market, as it is still trading at attractive valuations relative to historical levels, with a forward Price-to-Earnings ratio of 7.0x and a dividend yield of 7.7%. These favorable metrics present compelling investment opportunities for those with a medium- to long-term investment horizon.
