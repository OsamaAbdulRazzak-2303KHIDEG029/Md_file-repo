# Alfalah Asset Management Limited Fund Managers' Report May 2025

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s external position remained relatively stable in April 2025, though the current account surplus number arrived at USD 12 million, down sharply from USD 1.2 billion in March 2025. Nonetheless, the cumulative current account for 10MFY25 posted a surplus of USD 1.9 billion, a notable turnaround from the deficit of USD 1.3 billion recorded in the same period last year, reflecting improved external balances supported by resilient remittances and a managed import profile.

Workers’ remittances continued to demonstrate strength, growing by 13% YoY to USD 3.2 billion in April 2025, albeit reflecting a 22% MoM decline from the seasonally elevated March inflows of USD 4.1 billion. On a cumulative basis, remittances reached USD 31.2 billion in 10MFY25, marking a 31% YoY increase.

Inflationary pressures continued to ease, with May 2025 CPI expected at approximately 3.5% YoY — reflecting lower food prices, contained energy costs, and currency stability. If these dynamics persist, inflation is likely to remain subdued in the near term, giving the central bank room to consider further monetary easing.

Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) continued to exhibit mixed trends. While output rose by 1.79% YoY in March 2025, it contracted by 4.6% on a MoM basis. For the 9MFY25 period, LSM output declined by 1.5% YoY, indicating lingering weakness in the industrial base despite a nascent recovery in select segments.

Looking ahead, the month of June holds significant importance for economic direction and market sentiment. The Federal Budget FY26, scheduled for June 10, is expected to outline the government’s medium-term fiscal consolidation plan, likely under the purview of IMF reform benchmarks.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Investor sentiment in the fixed income market strengthened over the month as yields across the secondary market saw a broad-based decline. Short-term yields dropped by 94 basis points, while longer-duration instruments posted a 52 basis point decline. This yield compression followed the State Bank of Pakistan’s (SBP) move on May 5, 2025, to cut the benchmark policy rate by 100 basis points to 11.0%. With this adjustment, the central bank has now eased by a total of 1,100 basis points since June 2024—a decisive pivot towards a pro-growth monetary stance.

The SBP’s decision was underpinned by a material softening in inflationary pressures, particularly driven by reduced electricity tariffs and a continued decline in food prices. Core inflation also moderated, supported by a favorable base effect and restrained consumer demand, offering policymakers room to stimulate the economy further without stoking inflation.

In terms of market operations, the SBP conducted a Treasury bill auction on May 27, 2025, with maturities totaling PKR 818 billion—overshooting the auction target of PKR 650 billion. Investor appetite remained robust, with cut-off yields settling at 11.10% for 1-month, 11.15% for 3-month, 11.18% for 6-month, and 11.20% for 12-month instruments. Earlier in the month, on May 7, a fixed-rate Pakistan Investment Bond (PIB) auction was held, where the central bank accepted bids worth PKR 106 billion in 2-year, PKR 72 billion in 3-year, PKR 69 billion in 5-year, and PKR 53 billion in 10-year tenors. The respective cut-off yields were 11.79%, 11.69%, 12.14%, and 12.59%.

Looking ahead, while the disinflation trend provides a favorable backdrop for bond investors, the scope for further rate cuts will likely hinge on the central bank’s comfort with foreign exchange reserve buffers. For fixed income investors, the current environment suggests potential for capital gains, particularly at the mid-to-long end of the yield curve, provided macro stability is sustained.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index experienced a turbulent yet ultimately resilient performance during May 2025, marked by a sharp shift in sentiment from geopolitical anxiety to economic optimism. The month commenced under pressure as escalating tensions between Pakistan and India weighed heavily on investor confidence. This unease culminated in a historic single-day plunge of 6,482 points on May 8, with the index closing at 103,527 — the steepest point-wise decline in its history. However, the correction proved to be short-lived. As geopolitical risks subsided, market sentiment rebounded swiftly, triggering an extraordinary recovery. The KSE-100 staged its largest-ever single-day gain, surging 10,123 points (+9.45%) to close at 117,298 — a new record both in absolute and percentage terms. This dramatic turnaround was further supported by a series of encouraging macroeconomic developments.

In tandem, the SBP’s foreign exchange reserves saw a notable improvement, rising by 13% MoM to $11.5 billion by the end of May, largely on the back of IMF inflows. This bolstered investor confidence and contributed to a broader market recovery, with the KSE-100 Index closing the month at 119,691 points — up 7.5% MoM, reflecting a robust rebound from early-month lows.

Market participation also strengthened, with average daily traded volumes increasing 9% MoM to 566 million shares. Activity remained skewed toward high-interest sectors, led by Technology, Power, Cement, Food, and Refineries. From a performance contribution perspective, key drivers of the index’s gains were Banks (+2,328pts), Fertilizer (+1,192pts), Exploration & Production (+917pts), Cement (+885pts), and Investment Banks (+822pts). On the flip side, marginal pressure came from Auto Assemblers (-56pts), Tobacco (-6pts), and Auto Parts (-6pts).

On the foreign portfolio investment (FPI) front, flows were mixed. While regional markets like Taiwan, India, and South Korea witnessed substantial foreign inflows, the KSE saw net foreign outflows of $13 million in May. Selling pressure was concentrated in E&Ps (-$8.8mn), Banks (-$7.6mn), and Other Sectors (-$3.9mn), partially offset by foreign buying in Cement ($9.9mn) and OMCs ($2.6mn).

From a valuation lens, the KSE-100 continues to present an attractive entry point. The index is currently trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio (PER) of 6.4x for 2025, significantly below its 10-year average of 8.0x. The combination of discounted valuation and strong income potential underscores the case for long-term investors.
