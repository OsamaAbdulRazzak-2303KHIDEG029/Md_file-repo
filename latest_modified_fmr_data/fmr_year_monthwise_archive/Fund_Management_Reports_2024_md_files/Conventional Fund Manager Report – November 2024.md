Fund Managers' Report November 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s cumulative current account surplus for the four months of Fiscal Year 2025 stands at USD 218 million, positioning the country to potentially post its first annual current account surplus since FY11. This positive performance is primarily driven by growth in remittances and exports. Exports in November 2024 saw a notable increase of 9% on year-on-year (YoY), reaching USD 2.8 billion, while imports declined by 2.9% to USD 4.39 billion, narrowing the trade deficit by 18.6% to USD 1.59 billion. At the same time, remittances remained health and have contributed significantly to the overall positive current account performance.

On the foreign exchange front, Pakistan’s foreign reserves have seen consistent growth since the commencement of the IMF program, reaching USD 11.4 billion, the highest level since April 2022. Meanwhile, the Consumer Price Index (CPI)-based inflation for November 2024 stood at 4.9%, down from 7.2% in October 2024, largely driven by base effects. This marks the lowest inflation reading in the past 79 months. The real interest rate currently remains significantly positive at 10.1%, and further interest rate cuts are expected, with the policy rate likely to decline to around 12.0% by June 2025.

On the fiscal side, Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) tax collections increased by 23.3% in the first five months of FY25, reaching PKR 4,295 billion, though they fell short of the target by PKR 344 billion.

In the energy sector, the government is in discussions with Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to renegotiate Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs) with the aim of reducing capacity payments and, ultimately, electricity prices, which would provide relief to consumers. However, substantial changes in these agreements could potentially discourage future foreign investment in the sector.

Despite these signs of economic recovery, Pakistan continues to face significant challenges. Rising taxes and declining real wages are eroding consumer purchasing power, while political tensions are escalating as the ruling coalition pushes for constitutional amendments, raising concerns about the democratic process. Additionally, regional conflicts and a fragile law and order situation remain risks, particularly in relation to global commodity price fluctuations. As the country navigates these complexities, the focus must remain on implementing effective policies to ensure long-term economic stability and sustainable growth.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In November 2024, short-term secondary market yields fell by an average of 103 basis points (bps), while longer-term yields saw a smaller decline of 13bps. This easing in yields is largely driven by expectations of another 200 bps rate cut in the upcoming monetary policy in December 2024. The decline in yields is also influenced by the ongoing reduction in inflation and the SBP's buyback of Market Treasury Bills in previous months, which has exerted additional downward pressure on secondary market yields.

On November 27, 2024, the SBP held a Treasury bill auction with a total maturity of PKR 918 billion, surpassing the target of PKR 800 billion. The SBP accepted bids totaling PKR 171 billion for 3-month, PKR 92 billion for 6-month, and PKR 305 billion for 12-month tenors, with cut-off yields of 13.00%, 12.89%, and 12.35%, respectively. Additionally, on November 20, 2024, the SBP conducted an auction for fixed-coupon PIB bonds with a target of PKR 300 billion. The SBP accepted bids worth PKR 150 billion for 2-year bonds, PKR 18 billion for 3-year bonds, PKR 164 billion for 5-year bonds, and PKR 37 billion for 10-year bonds, with cut-off rates of 13.05%, 12.50%, 12.70%, and 12.84%, respectively.

Looking ahead, the outlook for inflation remains favorable, supported by currency stability and a positive base effect. The ongoing decline in inflation, coupled with improvement in external accounts following Pakistan's entry into IMF Program, provides ample room for the SBP to continue its monetary easing cycle. The pace and timing of future rate cuts will depend on factors such as the trend in foreign exchange reserves, external economic outlook.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index reached a record high of 101,357 points in November 2024, registering a historic monthly gain of 13.9% MoM. This exceptional performance was driven by several positive factors, most notably the higher-than-expected 250bps policy rate cut by the State Bank of Pakistan, which exceeded market expectations. Additionally, the market was buoyed by improvements in macroeconomic indicators, including declining inflation, rising foreign exchange reserves, and a positive current account balance, all of which bolstered investor confidence. Furthermore, the political landscape, which had been uncertain, began showing signs of stability, reinforcing expectations of policy continuity and further supporting the market rally.

The banking, fertilizer, and exploration and production (E&P) sectors emerged as the primary contributors to the index's rise, adding 3,753, 1,756, and 1,580 points, respectively. The banking sector benefitted from the SBP's decision to eliminate the minimum deposit rate (MDR) for corporates and financial institutions. Meanwhile, the fertilizer sector drew significant interest due to its attractive dividend yields, especially in a market characterized by declining secondary money market and bond yields. The E&P sector also saw a surge in investor interest, driven by improved liquidity and stronger cash flows within the sector.

November also witnessed a substantial uptick in market activity. The average daily trading volume surged 68% MoM, reaching 875 million shares, while the average traded value rose by 28% MoM to USD 118 million. Despite this strong local momentum, foreign investors were net sellers, with a net outflow of USD 58 million. In contrast, local institutional investors, particularly mutual funds and insurance companies, were active buyers, registering net inflows of USD 39 million and USD 24 million, respectively.

Looking ahead, investors will closely monitor key macroeconomic indicators and the government's efforts to meet the conditions outlined in the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) ahead of the upcoming IMF review. Local and geopolitical developments, as well as the SBP’s monetary policy stance following recent rate cuts, will also influence market direction. Despite the recent rally, we maintain a positive outlook as the market remains undervalued relative to historical levels. With a forward Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of
