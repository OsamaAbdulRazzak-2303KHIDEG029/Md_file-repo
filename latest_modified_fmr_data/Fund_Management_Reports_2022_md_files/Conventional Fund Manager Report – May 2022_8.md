## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit for the month of Apr-2022 registered at US$623mn relative to a deficit of US$268mn in same period last year, on account of higher imports.

Cumulatively, current account deficit reached at US$13.78bn in 9MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$0.543bn last year on account of bull-run in the commodity prices and improvement in economic activity. The war between Russia and Ukraine is continuously affecting the global economy. Russian invasion of Ukraine impacted the global supply chain and trade across the globe. Consequently, commodity prices witnessed strong surge as oil prices are hovering above US$110bbl (highest level since 2012). Along with this, prices of non-energy commodities are also at their respective historic highs.

PKR hit new low against USD of 202.01 due to continued pressure on forex reserves on account of high CAD and external debt repayments.

Inflation for the month of May clocked in at 13.76% YoY, mainly due to increase in non-perishable food items, contributing 0.93% in the overall MoM change of 0.44%. On the flip side, perishable food and the housing index fell by 0.61% and 0.51% on MoM basis respectively. Housing index fell mainly due to reduction in electricity charges by 15%.

On account of higher than expected inflation levels and to control the current account deficit and bleeding FX reserves, the Central Bank raised policy rate by 150bps to 13.75% during the month of May. According to the Committee, the rate hike along with fiscal consolidation would moderate demand growth to a more sustainable pace keeping inflation in check and also help to achieve external account sustainability.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

On May 23, 2022, the Central Bank raised policy rate by another 150bps to 13.75%. According to the Committee, the rate hike along with fiscal consolidation would moderate demand growth to a more sustainable pace, keeping inflation in check and help to achieve external account sustainability.

Inflation for the month of May clocked in at 13.76% YoY, mainly due to increase in non-perishable food items, contributing 0.93% in the overall MoM change of 0.44%. On the flip side, perishable food and the housing index fell by 0.61% and 0.51% on MoM basis respectively. Housing index fell mainly due to reduction in electricity charges by 15%.

For longer tenors, yield for 3 years increased by 32bps while yield for 5 year witnessed a decline of 4bps.

SBP conducted T-bill auction on May 18th, 2022. The auction had total maturity of PKR 279bn compared to target of PKR 500bn. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 234bn in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 59bn in 6 months’ tenors & PKR 56bn in 12 months’ tenor at cut-off yield of 14.49%, 14.70% & 14.75% respectively.

The next monetary policy is scheduled on July 07, 2022, where the market expects another hike in the policy rate as inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months, fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 fell by 4.80% during the month of May to close at 43,078.14 points. The average daily volume increased by 46.2% on MoM basis as it clocked at 115.88mn compared to previous month’s level of 121.54mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$8.82mn compared to a net outflow of US$5.07mn in April, where the buying was concentrated in Oil and Gas Exploration sector (US$0.57mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$6.38mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Political chaos prevailed during the month as ex PM called for march towards the capital seeking early elections; b) Central Bank raised policy rate by 150bps to 13.75% in order to curtail overheating of the economy and keep inflation & CAD in check; and c) PKR hit new low against USD of 202.01 due to continued pressure on forex reserves on account of high CAD and external debt repayments.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 61% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases fell substantially by 60% to close at 3.38k at end of the month, compared to 3.45k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Automobiles contributed the most to the index i.e. 107 points as the manufacturers increased product prices in order to pass on the cost pressures. On the contrary, Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 626 points on rumors of excess taxation on the sector.

Resolution of the Political crisis, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
