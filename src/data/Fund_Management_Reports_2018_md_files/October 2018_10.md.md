October 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing (LSM) contracted 1.17% in 2M FY19, on the back of decline in pharmaceuticals and non-metallic mineral products. POL product sales, which are a leading indicator of demand growth in an economy, also depicted a decline during the month of October. Even though majority of the decline is in Furnace oil (FO) sales, as it was principally decided to reduce the import of FO, however both motor gasoline and high speed diesel sales have also shown a decline of 2.5% and 19% YoY respectively.

There are fears that economic growth is likely to recede due to the government’s measures to contain the fiscal and current account deficits. These measures include raising gas and electricity tariffs and slashing down of development budget, all of which will negatively affect economic growth.

CPI grew by 7.0% in October due to a hike in gas prices, growth in house rent index and persistent rise in non-food non-energy (NFNE) items. Inflation is expected to surge further in the coming months due to (i) persistently high local fuel prices and their lagged effect on other items, (ii) PKR devaluation, (iii) gas and electricity tariff hike and their lagged effect on NFNE, and (iv) base effect.

Pakistan’s external position continued to worsen during the month of October, with foreign exchange reserves down to USD 14.2bn from USD 14.9bn at the end of September. The country is awaiting inflows following promises of a bailout package by Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Pakistan is currently also pursuing China and IMF for loans, which will help the country’s reserves position in the coming months. Meanwhile, current account deficit remained at an improved level in September. Total deficit for 1QFY19 was recorded at USD 3.7bn, which is lower than the deficit of USD 3.8bn posted for the corresponding period last year.

Given the outlook on inflation and external position, it is likely that SBP will raise policy rate by a further 50-100bps in November 2018.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, the yield curve remained steep signaling signs of deteriorating economic conditions; the shift is in line with the expectations of further monetary tightening. Little to no activity was witnessed in longer tenure bonds as the market participants remained on the sidelines during the bond auction. However, overwhelming participation was witnessed in both the T-bill auctions as the central bank was able to fetch PKR 3.3 trillion compared to PKR 41.2 billion in the preceding month. Participation was mostly concentrated in the 3 months followed by 6 months with no participation in 12 months. Cutoffs for 3 months and 6 months initially stood at 8.80% and 8.84% respectively, the cutoff for 3 month was maintained at second auction whereas 6 months and 1-year bids were rejected.

Going forward, with the support funds from friendly countries especially Saudi Arabia and China shall provide a much needed breather to our constantly deteriorating economic indicators especially the balance of payment and current account deficit; however the required stability in economy will stem from deep rooted structural reforms.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After two consecutive months of declines, the KSE-100 Index posted a positive return for the month of October, gaining 1.6% to close at 41,649. Activity was robust during the month with KSE-100 index’s daily turnover averaging at 128m shares in October, up 64.6% MoM. This is the highest daily average for any month this calendar year.

During the first half of the month, the index declined by 10.6% to its low of 36,663 points on the back of dismal quarterly results and ambiguity regarding the balance of payment issues. HBL was the top contributor to the Index’s declines as it surprised investors yet again with a significant jump in administrative expenses. Other banks too disappointed investors as their net interest income took a hit by re-pricing of deposits and a lag in re-pricing of assets. However, during the 2nd half of the month, the index recovered 13.6% from its intra-month low as the market rejoiced on the back of assurance by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to commit USD 3bn to Pakistan as balance of payment support for one year and to supply USD 3bn worth of oil on deferred payment for three years. The rally was further fueled by expectations that other friendly countries will also offer support for Pakistan’s balance of payments.

Fertilizer and Oil and Gas E&P, Power Generation and Cement Sectors drove the Index upwards. On the other hand, however, the index heavy-weight Banking Sector held the market back as it posted poor results in the earnings season for the September quarter. Going forward, prospects of loans from friendly countries and IMF will drive the market forward. Other key events that are likely to impact are market are i) MSCI Semi-annual Index review scheduled for mid-November and ii) Monetary policy announcement at the end of November, wherein a 50-100bps policy rate hike is expected.
