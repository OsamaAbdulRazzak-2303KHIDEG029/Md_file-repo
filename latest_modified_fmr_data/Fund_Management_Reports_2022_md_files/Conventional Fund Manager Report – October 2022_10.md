Fund Managers' Report October 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps. Reduction in energy and major commodity prices will be a real boost for Pakistan which will ultimately result in reduction in the import bill and consequently Current Account deficit. Moreover, this will provide a much needed respite to FX reserves.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms).

The Current Account posted a deficit of $2.2 billion for 1QFY23 as against a deficit of $3.5 billion during the same period last year. For the month of September, the CAD shrunk to $316 million as against $1.15 billion in Sep 2021, largely on the back of shrinkage in trade deficit due to decline in imports. Remittances shrank 12% during Sep’22, mainly due to volatility in PKR.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Moreover, the country received $1.5bn from Asian Development Bank under BRACE program to support the government’s efforts to deal with the adverse impacts of devastating floods, supply chain disruptions, rising energy, fuel prices and inflation on the poor and vulnerable. As a result, foreign exchange reserves jumped to $14.6bn from $13.3bn at the end of previous month.

The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the last monetary policy decision held on October 10, 2022, SBP maintained the policy rate at 15%. The motive behind the status quo was expected moderation in domestic demand and lower import bill expected for the month of October.

Inflation for the month of October clocked in at 26.6% YoY, mainly due to surge in Food prices because of widespread floods that have devastated crops and farmlands and also because of quarterly adjustment in built in electricity tariffs. Food and Housing index contributed 91% of the overall MoM change.

Secondary market yields for short term instruments up to 3 months increased by an average of 29bps, while yields from 6M to 12M increased by an average of mere 1bp. For longer tenors, yield for 5 and 10 years increased by 6bps each.

SBP conducted T-Bill auction on October 19, 2022 having total maturity of PKR 1,063bn against target of PKR 1,100bn. Total bids worth PKR 600bn were accepted in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 39bn in 6 months’ tenor & PKR 162bn in 12 months’ tenor at a cut-off yield of 15.72%, 15.74% & 15.75% respectively. The cutoff rate decreased by an average of 26bps compared to last month.

Auction for Fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on October 12, 2022 having a total target of PKR 175bn. The government accepted bids worth PKR 96bn in 3 years & PKR 131bn in 05 years at a cutoff rate of 13.84% & 13.09% respectively compared to 13.92% and 13.09% in 03 & 05 years in the previous month.

Going forward, market expects SBP to keep the policy rate unchanged at 15% in the upcoming monetary policy. Moreover, global commodity prices and rising domestic inflation will be key for Monetary Policy Committee in setting interest rates in future.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 remained steady throughout the month as it posted a return of mere 0.33% during the month of October to close at 41,264.66 points. The average daily volume increased by 1.7% on MoM basis as it clocked at 95.8mn compared to previous month’s level of 94.19mn. Foreigners remained net buyers, as the net foreign inflow during the current month amounted to US$14.37mn compared to a net inflow of US$14.59mn in September, where the buying was concentrated in Technology and Communication (US$18.35mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$4.94mn.

Key developments during the month include a) PTI commenced long march towards the capital creating more political uncertainty b) Pakistan was removed from grey list of FATF after 4 years, c) SBP maintained policy rate at 15% citing already implemented measures sufficient to curtail overheating of the economy, d) Inflation for the month of October rebounded to 26.6% compared to 23.2% in September. Increase in electricity prices due to quarterly adjustment and hike in food prices were key reasons for the upsurge in inflation.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 63% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases decreased substantially by 25% to close at 2.6k at end of the month, compared to 3.47k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Power generation and distribution companies contributed the most to the index i.e. 278 points. On the contrary, cements contributed negatively to the index the most by 56 points.

Macroeconomic fundamentals particularly PKR USD parity, CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
