Alfalah Asset Management Limited Fund Managers' Report June 2025

Economic &#x26; Capital Markets Review

Economic Review &#x26; Outlook

In June 2025, Pakistan’s trade deficit narrowed by 9.5% MoM to USD 2.32 billion, as exports declined 4.8% to USD 2.54 billion and imports fell 7.1% to USD 4.87 billion. This contraction in trade gap reflects easing import demand and suggests a manageable current account balance for the month.

Over the first eleven months of FY25, Pakistan posted a cumulative current account surplus of USD 1.81 billion, on track for its first full-year surplus since FY2011. Supporting this, SBP’s reserves rose by USD 3 billion in June—reaching USD 14.5 billion, comfortably exceeding the IMF’s end-June target of USD 13.9 billion, aided by multilateral inflows and commercial borrowings.

On the inflation front, headline CPI for June 2025 stood at 3.23% YoY, slightly up from 3.46% in May, though still well within comfortable levels. This minor uptick was mainly due to the base effect, as the corresponding period last year had witnessed sharp disinflation. More importantly, core inflation—which excludes volatile food and energy prices—eased to 7.8% from 8.0%, reflecting subdued underlying inflationary pressures. Overall, the average inflation for FY25 clocked in at 4.49%, a dramatic decline from the 23.4% recorded in FY24, underscoring the success of tighter monetary policy and improved supply-side dynamics in containing price pressures.

On the fiscal side, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) reported tax collections of PKR 11,735 billion for FY25, registering a robust growth of 26.4% compared to the previous year. While this performance reflects better tax compliance and broadened collection efforts, it still fell slightly short of the revised annual target by PKR 178 billion. The shortfall highlights the ongoing challenge of fiscal consolidation and the need for further reforms in tax administration and documentation to ensure sustainability.

### Money Market Review &#x26; Outlook

In June 2025, Pakistan’s secondary bond market witnessed pronounced volatility, largely influenced by heightened geopolitical tensions, particularly in the Middle East. Uncertainty surrounding the Iran-Israel conflict led to a surge in risk premiums, pushing yields on both short- and long-term government securities higher. Specifically, short-term yields peaked at 11.19% and long-term yields touched 11.85%, reflecting increases of 19 and 15 basis points from May’s closing levels. However, investor sentiment recovered following the announcement of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire late in the month, which helped ease market anxiety and resulted in a modest decline of 8 basis points in yields by the month’s end.

During its Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting on June 16, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) opted to keep the benchmark policy rate unchanged. The central bank cited ongoing inflationary risks and external vulnerabilities as key reasons behind its decision, emphasizing the importance of maintaining stability in light of global and regional uncertainties.

On the liquidity management front, the SBP conducted a T-bill auction on June 25, accepting bids worth PKR 327 billion across different tenors. The breakdown included PKR 14 billion for 1-month bills at a cut-off yield of 11.00%, PKR 96 billion for 3-month at 11.00%, PKR 66 billion for 6-month at 10.90%, and PKR 151 billion for 12-month at 10.93%. This distribution reflected the market's cautious outlook and the central bank’s measured stance on interest rates.

In the June 18 PIB auction, the SBP raised PKR 296 billion across various tenors, with strong participation in 2- to 15-year bonds at yields ranging from 11.39% to 12.70%. The response reflects market confidence in the interest rate outlook. Looking ahead, fixed income performance will depend on inflation trends, foreign exchange reserves, and external funding. While easing inflation offers room for potential rate cuts, the SBP is expected to remain cautious until macroeconomic fundamentals show sustained improvement.

### Equity Market Review &#x26; Outlook

The KSE-100 Index concluded June 2025 on a strong footing, closing at an all-time high of 125,627 points. This represented a 5.0% month-on-month gain and capped off an exceptional year for Pakistan’s equity market. For FY25, the benchmark index delivered a robust return of 60.2% in local currency terms (57.1% in USD), making it the second-highest annual gain in more than two decades—only trailing FY24’s extraordinary 89% return. The performance highlights sustained investor confidence, improved macroeconomic stability, and a resilient corporate earnings outlook.

The month began on a positive note, supported by investor optimism surrounding the announcement of the federal budget for FY26. The budget was received as market-friendly, with no major tax shocks or structural fiscal tightening, contrary to earlier market speculation. This encouraged a rally in the first half of June, with the index surging over 4,500 points. However, the momentum was disrupted midway through the month by geopolitical tensions—particularly the flare-up in hostilities between Iran and Israel—which triggered a broad-based sell-off and pulled the index down to a low of 116,167 points.

Despite the correction, markets rebounded strongly toward the end of the month after a U.S.-brokered ceasefire de-escalated tensions. The easing of geopolitical risks, combined with continued optimism around Pakistan’s macroeconomic direction, contributed to a swift recovery, ultimately allowing the index to post a new closing high.

Trading activity improved markedly during the month, with average daily volumes climbing 41.4% MoM to 800.2 million shares—a sign of growing retail and institutional participation. However, average daily traded value edged lower by 2.9% to USD 105 million, suggesting a tilt toward higher activity in lower-priced or second-tier stocks. Foreign investors continued to remain cautious, recording net outflows of USD 37.6 million for the month, whereas local participants, particularly Individuals and Corporates, emerged as net buyers with a combined inflow of USD 38.1 million. Brokers, on the other hand, were net sellers with an outflow of USD 2.7 million.

Despite the recent strong gains, valuations remain attractive. The KSE-100 Index trades at a forward P/E of 6.6x, comfortably below its historical average of approximately 7.5x, and offers a robust dividend yield of 7.8%. Coupled with improving corporate profitability and greater external sector stability, these factors present a compelling risk-reward profile for investors with a medium- to long-term investment horizon. As macroeconomic conditions continue to stabilize and earnings momentum builds, the equity market appears well-positioned for further upside potential.
