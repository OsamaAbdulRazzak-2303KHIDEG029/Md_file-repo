Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report February 2017

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The CPI inflation in February 2017 clocked in at 4.2% vs. 3.7% in January 2017. The MoM inflation increased by 0.3%, the YoY increase is linked to the fall in prices in Feb 2016 (base effect), especially perishable food prices. Going forward, average inflation for CY17 is expected to fall in the range of 4% - 4.25%.

Pakistan Current Account (CA) Deficit has widened by 90% to reach USD 4.7bn (2.5% of GDP), which is mainly attributed to shrinking remittances and higher trade deficit, as textile exports are down 5% while imports are up 9% despite subdued oil prices. To cater to the falling exports, GoP has announced a USD 1.6bn exports package, providing incentives (rebates and duty cuts on raw material imports) to export oriented sectors, especially textiles. On the import front, the SBP has now imposed 100% cash margin on few luxury/ non-essential consumer items. As most of the importers in this category are small organizations, higher liquidity requirement would discourage the imports while it would also help accommodating incremental growth - inducing capital goods, as per SBP.

The overvalued currency, coupled with absence of CSF and IMF inflows amid dismal FDI, has pushed current account deficits to north of USD 1.0 billion per month. According to data released by SBP, remittances received in January amounted to USD 1.49 bn, which reflects a decline of 6.1%/1.5% on MoM/YoY basis. Furthermore, the foreign exchange reserves have declined by 1.5% in February to USD 21.9 bn.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In the month of February, bond yields remained relatively stagnant as no major activity was witnessed in the fixed income market. The participation in the PIB auction held on 22nd February 2017 validated the position of institutions in shorter tenure as majority of the participation was witnessed in 3 year bond (PKR 92 Billion) followed by 5 year (PKR 17 Billion) and 10 year (PKR 4 Billion) bonds. The results of the PIB auction showed stagnant trend as the results were maintained at 6.40%, 6.89% and 7.90% in 3, 5 and 10 years respectively. The results of the latest MTB auction of 15th February 2017 also showed a stable trend as the cut offs for 3month, 6 month, and 12 month were maintained at 5.9463%, 5.9896% and 5.9935% respectively. The target for the auction amounted to PKR 550 billion out of which a massive total of PKR 630 billion was accepted, highlighting the interest of institutions in shorter tenors as compared to longer tenors.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

During the Month of February the KSE-100 lost 0.5% (223 points) MoM in Feb 2017. KSE-100 benchmark closed the month at 48,534 points while the average daily volume and value traded ranged around 140 mn and PKR 11.7 bn for the month. SECP’s stringent stance over new broker’s regulation, global pressure following President Trump’s adverse comments, fresh wave of terrorism and Panama hearing and political instability subdued the performance for the month. The Supreme Court have reserved its judgment over Panama corruption case, to be announced later, making market participants to keep a close eye for clarity on the subject. All the factors stated above caused uneasiness among the investors especially individuals and the market remained fairly volatile for the month. This could be ascertained from the fact that the maximum movement during the month alone was around -2.97%, before it started to recover and settled to a MoM decrease of -0.5%. During the period Index touched a maximum of 49,965.03 points and dropped to a minimum of 48,520.75 points.

Individuals were the major net sellers with USD 43 mn followed by Banks/DFIs with USD 10.1mn. On other hand, mutual funds industry remained the net buyers with USD 47.9mn, due to higher industry AUMs that rose to PKR 613 bn as of Jan 17 (up 4.4% MoM). Total foreign outflow for the outgoing month closed at USD 111m, taking the tally for 7MFY2017 to USD 409mn. The sector that outperformed during the month of February were Multi-utilities (+17.4%), Textile (+2.64%) and Cements (+2.2%). The sector that underperformed the benchmark were electricity (-5.7%), Pharmaceutical (-4.4%) and Oil & Gas (-1.6%). Among the SUI twins, SNGP, rose by a hefty 22% MoM while the antidumping duties and expansion news contributed to 31% price rise in the steel sector amid volatility. Oil & Gas sector declined by 2% following announcement of divestment plans for OGDC and MARI, as well as below expectations result of PPL.
