Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for May clocked in at 3.16% YoY, in line with consensus estimate, but higher than the 2.1% reading of April 2015. Period (11MFY15) inflation now stands at 4.7% compared to 8.7% in the corresponding period last year. With pressure likely to build-up on food items in the upcoming Ramadan season, and some uptick already seen in petroleum prices, headline inflation is likely to inch up to 3.5% - 4.0% YoY in the months to come.

Current account numbers posted a positive surplus of USD 275mn in April 2015 as opposed to (revised) deficit of USD 20mn in March 2015. Trade deficit shrank by 26% MoM due to lower imports, while remittances continued to exhibit growth. Current account deficit for 10MFY15 now stands at USD 1.34bn, as opposed to USD 2.93bn witnessed in the corresponding period last year. Foreign exchange reserves rose by a hefty USD 1.4bn in April on account of release of IMF tranche and receipt of proceeds from HBL privatization.

The upcoming budget will be a key driver of sentiments, wherein the government is expected to step-up its reform agenda and take a number of actions to fix economic shortcomings. Higher tax collection seems to be of primary focus and some tough measures will undoubtedly be announced in this regard to shore up tax-to-GDP ratio.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The State Bank of Pakistan slashed the key policy rate by 100bps to 7% in the policy statement scheduled on May 23, 2015, and brought the overnight target rate down from 7.5% to 6.5%. Moreover, the regulator reduced the interest rate corridor from 250bps to 200bps. Since PLS deposit rate offered by commercial banks is set 50bps below the floor of the interest rate corridor by the State Bank of Pakistan, banks will now have to pay a relatively higher borrowing cost on deposits compared to their lending cost.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back of unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. Prior to the rate cut, the 3Y PIB traded at 7.26%, 5Y at 8.07% and 10Y at 9.22%. Clearly, the bond market had already priced in a 100bps cut in yields before the policy statement. Post-easing, treasury bills came off significantly, while PIBs posted only a marginal dip.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The benchmark equity index lost 2% in May, mainly due to sentiment-dampening budgetary news flow and rumored hike in Capital Gain Tax (CGT). We expect the budget to be tax-heavy as the government is reportedly seeking a high growth rate of 19% in tax collection for FY16.

Volumes of KSE-100 index fell by 45% to 108mn, while value traded declined by 41% MoM. Foreigners were net buyers of USD 15mn in May. The biggest net buy during the month came from Individuals (USD 34mn), while Companies were the biggest net sellers (USD 68mn).

Most of the ingredients for a buoyant market remain in place with discount rate and inflation at historical lows, and external account outlook stable. As alternate fixed income returns continue to drop, we see interest shifting towards equities. Uptick in oil prices should lead to improvement in E&P, Refineries and OMC results, while Cement sector is expected to benefit the most in lieu of proposed infrastructure and energy related spending (in the wake of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and proposed Public Sector Development Program).

The federal budget is scheduled for June 05, 2015, and is expected to set market direction in the immediate future. While recommendations to impose and withdraw duties and taxes have been received from different quarters of the economy, it needs to be seen to what extent suggestions are incorporated before future outlook can be determined.
