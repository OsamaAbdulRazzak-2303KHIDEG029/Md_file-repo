Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report October 2021

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Current Account Deficit (CAD) in Sep’21 registered at US$1,113mn, relative to a surplus of US$27mn in same period last year. The current account deficit is mainly attributed to increase in goods imports by 58%YoY to US$6.1bn which offset the remittances of US$2.7bn in the month of Sep’21. On the other hand, exports also witnessed an upside of 35%YoY to US$2.6bn during the same month. For the month of Oct’21, trade deficit reported at US$3.9bn showed a slight decline 7%YoY as announced by Pakistan Bureau of Statistics.

The PKR/USD parity hit an all-time high level of 175.3 amid pressure on balance of payments following bull-run in commodity market at international front. Crude oil prices have risen rapidly hitting a seven years high level of USD 85 per bbl amid supply and demand imbalances. The global oil consumption continued to recover and reaching near to its pre-pandemic levels. Similarly, coal, fertilizers and natural gas prices have escalated sharply to its record highs. The greater dependence on imports to meet the domestic demand have raised concerns on balance of payments. During the month the foreign exchange reserves registered a downward movement of US$23.9bn in Oct’21 as compared to USD$25.9bn in the previous month on account of debt repayment including US$1bn against Pakistan International Sukuk. The Government has also secured US$3bn from Saudi Arabia coupled with oil facility of US$1.2bn on deferred payment. Furthermore, Pakistan-IMF talks are underway for the release of US$1bn. We expect the rise in base power tariffs and petroleum development levy would pave way for the release.

Headline Inflation registered at 9.2%YoY in Oct’21 versus 9.0%YoY in the Sep’21. The inflation pace continued upward trajectory which was mainly led by food (+8.3%YoY), housing (+12%YoY) and transport (14.4%YoY) indexes. The increasing global commodity prices are being reflected in higher inflation pace and expected to surpass inflation target of 8.2%.

The economic activity kept the strong momentum as depicted in large scale manufacturing industries (LSMI) growth of 7.26%YoY during Jul-Aug’21. The Automobiles, Pharmaceuticals and Food sectors were the major contributors as they posted healthy growth of 55.3%YoY, 18.7%YoY and 6.7%YoY respectively.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of October the Yield curve further skewed upwards as most of the market participants are now of a firm view that there will be a hike in the discount rate in the upcoming monetary policy in November 2021 between the range of 50 to 100bps. This was depicted by the T-Bill auction conducted on 20th October, 2021 where the total maturity was PKR 582bn against a target of PKR 600bn. The auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 319bn in 3months, PKR 192bn in 6 month and PKR 203bn in 12month tenor. Against the said participation SBP only accepted 169bn in 3month tenor and that too at the rate of 8.25% increasing the cut off yield by 40bps while rejecting 6month and 12month participation.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on 27th October, 2021 with a total target of PKR 150 billion. Total participation of only PKR 193 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10, & 15 year tenor received bids worth PKR 72 billion, PKR 67 billion, PKR 55 billion, & PKR 0.6 billion respectively. All the bids were rejected by State Bank of Pakistan as the market participated at much higher levels as compared to the last auction.

Going forward, as indicated in last monetary policy statement, the policy will remain largely accommodative in the near term and a gradual adjustment will be made in order to achieve the mildly positive real rate over time. This decision would be largely dependent on the negotiations with IMF, international commodity prices and the tariff adjustments. In the current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index posted a return of 2.86% during the month of October to close at 46,185 points. The average daily volume decreased by 20% on MoM basis as it clocked at 119mn compared to previous month’s level of 149mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$26.92mn compared to a net outflow of US$44.94mn in September, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$24.58mn) while there was net buying in Power Generation and Distribution amounting to US$14.38mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Saudi Arabia agreed to provide assistance to Pakistan worth US$4.2bn in the form of US$3bn as deposit in the Central Bank and deferred oil facility of US$1.2bn; b) Global commodity prices started to decline as correction was observed in coal and steel prices as supply constraints started to ease; c) CAD amounted to US$1.1bn for the month of September on the back of increased imports due to rising commodity prices and d) PKR plunged to an all-time low of 175.2 against the greenback before recovering by month end and closing at a level of 171.65.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 32% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases decreased by stunning 53%, and stood at 22.57k at the end of the month, compared to 48.2 at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed the most to the index i.e. 915 points. On the contrary, Technology contributed negatively to the index the most by 586 points.
