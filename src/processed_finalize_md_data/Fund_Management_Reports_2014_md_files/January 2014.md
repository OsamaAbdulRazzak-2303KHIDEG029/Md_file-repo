## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

December current account number clocked in at positive USD285mn versus a deficit of USD572mn in November, showing a swing of USD857mn. 1HFY14 current account deficit numbers now stand at USD1,589mn as opposed to USD83mn witnessed in the 1HFY13, mainly due to lower CSF receipts.

CPI numbers for January clocked in at 7.9% YoY, as another MoM dip in perishable food prices kept the monthly CPI number in single digit. The lower than expected inflation numbers in Dec and Jan has altered the interest rate view of the market, with consensus now expecting interest rates to stabilize at current levels.

With current account deficit expected to remain between 1-2% of GDP and crude oil prices expected to remain flat/decline in the medium term, we are positive on the macros and rerating theme of Pakistan if the government is able to execute its reform process.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

We expect inflation to remain controlled during the remainder 5MFY14 since the government has largely tackled the food price issue. Urea price has been managed and no increase in the wheat support price will all help in this regard. PKR devaluation remains the key risk. Additionally, the Discount Rate at 10% means positive real interest rates for the rest of this fiscal year.

FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions.

Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. Nonetheless, since the government has to retire a hefty PKR454bn SBP borrowing as per IMF’s quarterly criteria of March 2014, securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month.

The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. Liquidity issues calling for 50bps hike in the next MPS to be held in mid March, in case the projected external flows (3G auction & multilateral financing) don’t materialize.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index showed another strong performance in January, appreciating by 1,523 points during the month, up 6.0% to close at 26,784 points with an average daily traded volume of 188.7 million shares. The index peaked at an all-time high level of 27,104 points in the third week; however this level could not be sustained and the market witnessed profit taking in the later part of the month.

With inflation remaining subdued for January as well, the macros look comfortable for now despite pressure on SBP reserves. CSF inflows in February and the 3G license auction in March is expected to improve the SBP reserve level. A positive outlook from IMF over quarterly disbursement is critical for market momentum continuing, while the Fed tapering and its impact on frontier markets will also need to be tracked.

Maturities from TDRs were redirected into this category, increasing the duration which allowed the capture of higher yields. Small percentage of TDR maturities were rolled over at above market rates which secured the fund return. Going forward, IGI MMF will maintain a strong presence in T-Bills, capturing the highest possible rates. The bottom line will be bolstered by placements at above market rates.
