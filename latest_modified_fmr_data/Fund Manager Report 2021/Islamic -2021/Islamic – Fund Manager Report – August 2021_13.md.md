## Sindh Workers' Welfare Fund (SWWF)

During the month of August 2021, provisioning against Sindh Workers’ Welfare Fund by Alfalah GHP Islamic Value Fund (AGIVF) amounting to Rs. 3.735 million has been reversed on the clarification received by Sindh Revenue Board vide letter No. SRB/TP/70/2013/8772 dated August 12, 2021 addressed to Mutual Funds Association of Pakistan.
