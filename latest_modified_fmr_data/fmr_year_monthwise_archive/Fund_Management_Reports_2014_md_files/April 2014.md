April, 2014

Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

CPI numbers rose again in April, clocking in at 9.18% YoY, due to higher than expected rise in Education, House rent and perishable food items. This coupled with the IMF focus on high real interest rates maintain the possibility of stable interest rate, rather than loosening monetary policy for the remainder of the year.

Inside this issue: March’s current account number clocked in at negative USD 156 million versus a positive USD 167 million in February. 9MFY14 current account deficit numbers now stand at USD 2,173 million as opposed to USD 1,255 million witnessed in the corresponding period last year, mainly due to lower CSF receipts. April’s current account deficit may rise slightly in our view, as the shock of PKR appreciation will be fully reflected in Aprils’ export numbers. Overall we expect reserves to remain elevated in 4QFY14 due to Eurobond proceeds, telecom auction proceeds, receipt of quarterly tranche of CSF and rising donor agencies flows in the upcoming months.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism that the approval of IMF will bring stability to swindling PKRUSD parity and will pave the way for further aid flows from other international lender institutions. Although the month witnessed end of monetary easing cycle, the market ignored the development to continue the upward march. As the news regarding government securing fresh IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact.

Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE turned in another strong performance in April with a 6.5% increase in the benchmark KSE-100 index, which closed at 28,912 points. Volumes also picked up during the month as the average daily turnover of the market rose by 34% to 205.9 million shares. The KSE-100 peaked at 29,250 points on Apr 10, driven by positive news on the macro front, including the oversubscribed Eurobond issue, and the successful auction of 3G/4G licenses.

As quarterly result season got underway in the latter half of the month, the market did witness a drop as majority of results were either inline or below expectations. Foreigners after being net sellers in March (outflow of USD5mn) changed gears in April, with net buying of USD92mn. With the result season almost over, we expect the market to remain range bound as budget related & mutual funds tax issue rumors will continue to cause volatility.

The longer duration allows the capture of more stable yields that have remained relatively unaffected by adverse revaluation movements in the shorter tenors.
