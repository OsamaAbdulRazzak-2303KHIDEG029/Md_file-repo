Fund Managers’ Report

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Headline inflation for November clocked in at 3.96% YoY – an eleven year low reading. The number came in below consensus expectations of the market for the second consecutive month. Another hefty cut in petroleum product prices during December, delay in domestic gas tariff rise and subdued weekly SPI numbers are likely to keep December’s CPI number below 5% as well. Given the subdued CPI outlook, another round of monetary easing (50-100bps) is on the cards in the next MPS review.

After witnessing improved current account numbers in September due to seasonal rise in remittances (Eid impact), the current account deficit number for October clocked in at USD0.3bn versus deficit (revised) of USD0.08bn in September. Current account deficit for 4MFY15 now stands at USD1.76bn as opposed to USD1.37bn in the CPLY.

The government aims to improve its performance metrics further by raising SBP reserves by USD2bn by quarter-end via USD denominated Sukuk Bonds and dollar purchases. Going forward, IMF’s meeting scheduled for December 17 shall be crucial for setting economic direction.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The Central Bank eased the discount rate by 50bps in November on account of unrelenting decline in headline inflation. Resultantly, bond yields reacted sharply down by approximately 150-190bps over the month – posting exceptional gains for investors who were long on sovereign bonds and on funds with high PIB exposures.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued Following the cut in interest rates, the Central Bank mopped up PKR 150bn in the PIB auction (November 19) against target of PKR 50bn and participation of 164bn. Cut-off yields in the auction clocked in at 10.90% for 3Y (-158bps), 11.1003% for 5Y (-187bps) and 11.9986% for 10Y (-145bps). The decision to mop-up an amount three times the target surprised the market as SBP had accepted only the targeted amount in October.

IMF failed to stabilize the PKR parity, the market witnessed outflow from foreign quarter in the last week wiping off all the gains made earlier in the month. The SBP’s move of pegging the minimum deposit rate with repo rate also battered the equities with Banks losing more than 10% in last few trading sessions. The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

With average annual inflation expected to clock in below 6% over FY15, we expect further monetary easing of 50-100bps over the remaining fiscal year. Logic dictates investment concentration in high duration funds.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market remained in positive territory in the early half of November and attained a new peak of 32,006. The rally was led by soft CPI numbers for October (5.8%), monetary easing expectations and higher purchasing power resulting from cancellation of OGDC’s secondary offering. The index ended the month at index level of 31,198 – up by 2.7%.

Volumes at the bourse saw an increase of 44% MoM in November, while value traded saw an uptick of 61%. Once again, market rally was led by relatively humble sectors (Pharma & Cement), while index heavy weights including likes of Oil & Gas sector and Banking sector turned red. Among the key sectors, Pharmaceutical sector saw the biggest rise in value as fund managers continued to bet on the long term growth prospects of the sector (introduction of new drugs & improved pricing policy). Among the laggards, Oil & Gas sector continued its MoM descent (E&Ps mainly) due to hefty drop in oil prices, which is yet to find a bottom post OPEC decision of maintaining supply.

Declining oil price is likely to result in pressure on CPI, and should be extremely beneficial for the external account. Better economic prospects amid declining interest rates ought to result in multiple re-ratings for the equity market.
