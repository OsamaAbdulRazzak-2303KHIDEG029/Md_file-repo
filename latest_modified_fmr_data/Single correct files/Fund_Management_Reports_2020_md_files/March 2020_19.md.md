Fund Managers' Report March 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s fragile path towards an economic recovery has been dented by the spread of COVID-19 infections, and it is likely that situation will get worse before it starts to get better. After taking various precautionary measures to curb the pandemic, provincial governments initiated lockdown in their respective jurisdictions from 23 March, which hampered economic activities across the country.

Pakistan’s GDP growth rate that clocked in at 3.3% in FY19, is anticipated to fall to 2.4% in FY20, according to IMF estimates. However, the World Bank has now revised the growth outlook to a bleaker 1.1% in FY20 due to the coronavirus situation. Foreign exchange reserves decreased by ~US$ 1,494 mn during the month to close at US$ 17.39bn as of 27 March 2020 on the back of a net outflow of $1.9 billion of foreign investments from government treasury bills, equity and bonds. Consequently, PKR came under pressure, depreciating by 8.1% against USD during the month.

Current Account registered a deficit of US$ 210 mn for Feb’20. In contrast, the current account recorded a deficit of US$ 338 mn in Feb’19. Similarly, CAD stood at US$ 2.9bn for 8MFY20, a massive decrease of 70% as compared to same period of last year. The external account situation had improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Exports during Feb’20 showed an increase of 6.3% YoY mainly due to resumption of shipments blocked in January and additional textile orders due to temporary closure of Chinese factories. Foreign remittances depicted a significant rise of 13% YoY for Feb’20.

Large scale manufacturing remained depressed in 7MFY20 taking relevant index down by 3.4% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline. CPI clocked in at an expected level of 12.40% for the month of Feb’20 due to decrease in food prices (especially wheat and sugar). We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months due to decrease in demand and lower petroleum prices.

Going forward, exports are likely to decline as many textile export orders from EU and USA have been cancelled due to the economic slowdown and other applicable travel restrictions. However, this can be more than offset by the decrease in oil imports due to the falling international oil prices as about 25% of the country’s oil import bill consists of petroleum products. Moreover, this also applies to non-essential imports, which are also expected to take a dip due to depressed economic activity and demand. Remittances can also be negatively impacted in the short term, as a) world's major economies have locked down cities to limit the spread of the virus and b) oil price decline which can result in slowdown in GCC and Middle East and restrict remittances inflows (55% contribution in total remittances).

To combat the current crisis, Government has approved a fiscal stimulus package of PKR 1.2tn to mitigate the impact of the lockdown by focusing on social safety nets for low income groups as well as providing small businesses with various reliefs. Moreover, government has started to release export tax refunds to the export sector on an immediate basis. The government has also laid out a comprehensive package for the revival of construction sector. In line with these actions, the SBP also slashed the discount rate by 225bps to restrict the economic slowdown in the outgoing month.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During March, market witnessed a sharp reduction in the policy rate bringing it down to 11% from 13.25%, a cumulative adjustment of 225 bps. Initially, Governor state bank in its bimonthly monetary policy statement reduced the benchmark interest rate by only 75 bps. However, during the last week of the month, SBP announced a special stimulus package in the wake of an anticipated economic slowdown due to the spread of COVID-19, and the benchmark rate was further slashed by 150bps. The development took place as the Corona virus epidemic is impacting both global and the domestic economy. The Monetary policy Committee was of the view that this cumulative easing would cushion growth slowdown while protecting the inflation expectations.

The secondary market had already incorporated around 150-200bps adjustment in discount rate as the yields across all tenors witnessed a massive drop. Investors were quite active in accumulating longer duration instruments ranging 12 months T-bill to 10-yr Bonds. T-bill Auction was conducted twice during the month in which a cumulative participation of PKR 2,979 billion was witnessed against the total target of PKR 850 billion. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 875 billion in a breakup of PKR 370 billion, PKR 254 billion and PKR 250 billion. The cut-off yield slide down to 11.29%, 11.29% and 10.86% in 3 months, 6 months and 12 months tenor respectively.

Auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds held in the month of March had a total target of PKR 100 billion. Total participation of PKR 400 billion was witnessed in this auction out of which 3, 5, 10 & 20 years tenor received bids worth PKR 243 billion, PKR 105 billion, 74 billion & PKR 1 billion respectively. Central Bank accepted PKR 38.3 billion in 3 years, PKR 32.15 billion in 5-yr and 38.1 billion in 10-yr tenor at a Cut off rate of 11.588%, 10.99% and 10.85% respectively.

Likewise the inflation for the month of March has dropped to 10.24%. We believe that the CPI will continue to drop to single digits owing to declining international oil prices and deceleration in food inflation as indicated by latest SPI figures. Hence we expect the easing momentum to continue in the coming months and eventually the discount rate would settle in single digits by first half FY21.

We will continue to closely monitor long term yields and will optimize portfolio duration of the funds in order to capitalize gains in the coming months.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index lost 23.04% during the month of March 2020 to close at 29,231.63 points. The average daily turnover saw an increase of 57% on a MoM basis as it clocked at 179mn in March, compared to previous month’s level of 114mn. Foreigners remained net sellers during the month as the net foreign outflow amounted to US$85mn as compared to a net inflow of US$55mn in Feb’2020. Foreign investors remained net buyers in Food & Personal Products (US$ 0.06mn) while they were sellers in all other sectors, led by Oil & Gas Exploration (US$ 21.48mn) and Cements (US$ 20.51mn).

Primary reason for negative performance during the month was a ripple effect of Covid-19 on global equities in addition to spread of the virus in Pakistan resulting in lockdowns announced by all provincial governments. The lockdown was also imposed on all industries barring some essential services like food, pharmaceuticals and fertilizers etc, resulting in complete shutdown in almost all business activity. The Government along with the SBP has taken measures like Financial Stimulus Package, Construction Package, reduction in discount rate and relaxations pertaining to consumer and corporate loans to fight the distress caused by the virus in most vulnerable segments of society, create new employment opportunities and mitigate losses to businesses. Few other sectors have been granted permission to resume their operations now including all Export, Construction, Packaging and Chemical sectors.

On a monthly basis, Commercial Banks contributed largest to the decline of KSE-100 index with 3,029 points, followed by Oil & Gas Exploration with 1583 points while Textile Spinning contributed positively to the index by mere 1.4 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals, how quickly the virus is controlled and resumption of normal business activities will determine market direction in the near term.
