# Alfalah Asset Management Limited Fund Managers' Report

Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

March 2025 brought encouraging developments for Pakistan’s economy, particularly on the external front. Exports rose by 5.1% month-on-month to USD 2.62 billion, while imports dipped slightly by 1.1% to USD 4.74 billion. As a result, the trade deficit narrowed by 7.8% to USD 2.1 billion. With strong remittance inflows during Ramazan, the current account has recorded a surplus of USD 691 million in the first eight months of FY25. Despite this progress, foreign exchange reserves fell by USD 550 million to USD 10.7 billion, mainly due to debt repayments.

On the inflation front, consumer prices showed a notable cooling. Headline CPI inflation eased to 0.69% in March—down from 1.52% in February—registering the lowest reading since December 1965. Core inflation remained unchanged at 8.98%. Though the recent drop is mostly due to base effects, a slight uptick in inflation is anticipated toward the end of the fiscal year. We expect CPI for FY25 to average around 5%-6%, a considerable decline from the 23.4% recorded in FY24.

In parallel, Pakistan made strides in its engagement with the IMF. A staff-level agreement was reached covering the first review of the ongoing 37-month Extended Fund Facility (EFF), along with a new 28-month Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF) program. This combined arrangement is expected to unlock approximately USD 1.3 billion, pending approval by the IMF Executive Board. An IMF mission is also anticipated in the coming months to assist with the formulation of the federal budget for FY2025-26.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Since June 2024, the SBP has reduced the policy rate by a total of 1,000 basis points, lowering the policy rate from 22.0% to 12.0%. The recent drop in global oil prices may provide additional downward pressure on inflation. However, while the outlook for inflation and imports has improved, potential weaknesses in exports and remittances, coupled with global economic uncertainties, may offset these gains. We expect the SBP to closely monitor these dynamics and make policy adjustments aimed at achieving a balance between macroeconomic stability and growth.

Short-term secondary market yields and longer-tenor yields rose during the month. The 3M PKRV increased by 68 basis points, 6M PKRV by 103 basis points, 1Y PKRV increased by 129 basis points, and 3Y PKRV increased by 136 basis points. This uptick in yields came after the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) decided to keep the monetary policy unchanged in its meeting on March 10, 2025, despite mixed market expectations. The SBP maintained the current interest rate, citing persistent core inflation between 8%-9%, and expressed concerns in case of rising food and energy prices could contribute to further inflationary pressures.

SBP conducted a Treasury bill auction on March 26, 2025, with a total maturity of PKR 412 billion against a target of PKR 650 billion. The central bank accepted bids totaling PKR 226 billion for 1-month bills, PKR 111 billion for 3-month bills, PKR 74 billion for 6-month bills, and PKR 195 billion for 12-month bills. The cut-off yields for these bills were 12.39%, 12.01%, 12.00%, and 12.01%, respectively. These rates were up by an average of 29 basis points compared to the previous auction.

Additionally, SBP held an auction for fixed coupon PIB bonds on March 12, 2025, with a total maturity of PKR 70 billion against a target of PKR 350 billion. The bank accepted bids worth PKR 6 billion for 5-year bonds and PKR 10 billion for 10-year bonds, with cut-off rates of 12.37% and 12.79%, respectively.

We anticipate a cumulative reduction of 1% to 2% in the policy rate by December 2025, primarily driven by the Central Bank’s long-term inflation expectations in the range of 5%-7%. However, core inflation has remained persistently high, hovering around 9%, which may limit the pace and extent of monetary easing. Additionally, recent escalations in global trade tensions could prompt the Central Bank to adopt a more cautious stance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

March 2025 brought a strong performance for the Pakistan Stock Exchange, with the KSE-100 Index achieving a record high of 118,769 points before closing the month at 117,807 points. This translated into a healthy 4.0% gain on a monthly basis, reflecting growing market confidence fueled by several key economic developments.

Momentum picked up early in the month following news of a government agreement with commercial banks to resolve a significant portion—PKR 1.2 trillion—of circular debt through subsidized debt arrangements. The rally gained further traction with the announcement of a staff-level agreement between Pakistan and the IMF under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF), alongside the approval of a USD 1.3 billion Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF).

Sector-wise, gains were primarily driven by Exploration & Production (E&P), Oil Marketing Companies (OMCs), and Banks, which together contributed more than 3,400 points to the index’s rise. On the flip side, Fertilizers, Leather, and Investment Companies dragged performance slightly, resulting in a modest cumulative pullback.

Despite this positive backdrop, market participation was somewhat restrained due to the shortened trading schedule during Ramazan. Daily average volumes dropped to 366 million shares, a 28.9% decline from the previous month, meanwhile, the average daily traded value held firm at USD 87 million. On the institutional side, foreign investors maintained their selling stance, leading to net outflows of USD 12 million. Among local players, Mutual Funds and Insurance firms reduced their exposure, while Banks and DFIs emerged as net buyers, balancing the overall sentiment.

The valuation backdrop remains highly attractive. The KSE-100 is currently trading at a forward P/E ratio of 6.5x, backed by improving fundamentals and a gradually stabilizing macroeconomic environment.
