Fund Managers' Report February 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Highest ever Current Account deficit of US$2,556mn was reported during the month of January 2022 compared to a deficit of US$219mn in same period last year due to higher imports and decline in worker’s remittances. Cumulatively, current account deficit reached to US$11.58bn in 7MFY22 versus a surplus of US$1.03bn last year mainly attributed to bull-run in the commodity cycle and improvement in economic activity. Oil prices have surged by 63% over the year to USD114 per bbl, the highest level since 2014 on account of deepening Russia-Ukraine crisis. In addition, prices of other commodities including natural gas, coal and wheat witnessed northward movement following the Russian attack on Ukraine.

Nevertheless, in an unexpected move, Prime Minister of Pakistan announced relief to the masses by reducing Petrol and HSD prices by PKR10 per liter along with reduction in electricity tariffs. The relief measures will last till the upcoming budget. To some extent, these steps would curtail inflation but on the flip side its economic repercussion would reflect in budgetary and external account deficits.

Furthermore, CPI reading in Feb’22 remained on higher side and clocked at 12.24%YoY mainly driven by higher prices of perishable food and petroleum products. We expect inflation would continue on higher side amid rising commodity prices.

Large Scale Manufacturing Index growth during Jul-Dec’21 stood at 7.5% over July-Dec’20. During Dec’21, production of Automobile and Wearing apparel witnessed an increase of 69.4%YoY and 20.5%YoY respectively.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Headline inflation started to decelerate after showing a high of 12.96% YoY in Jan’22, mainly on the basis of higher base. Having said that, on monthly basis, inflation started picking up as the headline inflation in February rose 1.2% MoM (highest in the last 3 months). This was mainly due to pressures originating from higher commodity prices, food index coupled with the transport index as international oil prices stayed on the higher side.

In response to above, yields in the secondary market witnessed pressure as 3m, 6m and 1year rates increased by 33bps, 32bps and 18bps respectively. Yield for 3year and 5year also increased by 16bps and 10bps respectively.

In the last T-bill auction held on 23rd Feb, 2022, the auction had a total maturity of PKR 816bn against a target of PKR 800bn. Auction witnessed a total participation of PKR 732bn. Out of total participation bids worth, PKR 348bn were received in 3 months’ tenor, PKR 228bn in 6 months, and PKR 157bn in 12 months’ tenor. SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 235bn in 3 months’, PKR 69bn in 6 months’ and PKR 31bn in 12 months’ at a cut-off yield of 10.4899%, 10.89%, and 10.9999%, respectively.

Auction for Fixed coupon PIB bonds was held on Feb 16th, 2022 with a total target of PKR 100bn. The SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 4bn in 3 years, PKR 45bn in 05 years & PKR 50.5bn in 10 years at cut off rates of 10.70%, 10.75% and 10.86% respectively.

The next monetary policy is scheduled on March 08, 2022, where the market expects a Status Quo. Having said that it would be a difficult decision for SBP given the outlook in the coming months is on the higher side, as food prices are likely to soar in Ramadan. Despite the fact that prices of major items like fuel and power tariff have been capped, imported inflation from food and impact of sales tax and exchange rate depreciation is expected to keep prices upwards.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 index posted negative return of 2.01% during the month of February to close at 44,461 points. The average daily volume decreased by 2.78% on MoM basis as it clocked at 96.98mn compared to previous month’s level of 99.75mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$15.03mn compared to a net inflow of US$17.57mn in January, where the buying was concentrated in Textiles (US$2.74mn) while there was net selling in Technology and Communication amounting to US$7.96mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Commodity prices mainly Energy i.e. coal, oil and natural gas surged again during the month of February as Russian forces entered Ukraine; b) CPI for the month of February clocked in at 12.24%, wherein perishable food items increased by 35% YoY mainly due to increase in Tomato prices by 192% and c) Decent results were posted by almost all the sectors in 2QFY22 as healthy growth was witnessed in profitability on YoY basis.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 58% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases fell substantially by 71% to close at 30.79k at end of the month, compared to 105.68k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Automobile assemblers contributed the most to the index i.e. 156 points. On the contrary, Technology contributed negatively to the index the most by 495 points.

Continuing negotiations with IMF regarding tariffs, macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
