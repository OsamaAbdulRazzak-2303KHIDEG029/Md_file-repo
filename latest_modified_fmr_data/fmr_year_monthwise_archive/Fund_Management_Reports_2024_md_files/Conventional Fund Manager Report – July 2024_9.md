Fund Managers' Report July 2024

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The first month of FY25 witnessed several significant macroeconomic events, all of which favored Pakistan. IMF and Pakistan have reached a Staff level Agreement on a 37 month Extended Fund Facility (EFF) expected to be around SDR 5,320mn (~US$7bn). This agreement builds on the economic stabilization achieved through the 2023 Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) that successfully concluded in May’24. This agreement is subject to approval by the IMF’s Executive Board, which should be forthcoming in the next few weeks and the timely confirmation of necessary financing assurances from Pakistan’s development and bilateral partners (particularly China and GCC states). The IMF program has provided much-needed certainty and assurance for our economic plan. Its guidance and support have strengthened the path towards sustainable growth and prosperity.

Real GDP growth for FY24 clocked in at 2.38% as compared to -0.21% in FY23. Growth remained in positive territory mainly because of strong growth in agriculture sector of 6.25% after being impacted adversely in FY23 due to mass destruction of major agriculture crops and livestock caused by floods.

Ample increase in export of 12% helped to curtail leakages in external account, as CAD for FY24 stood at USD 681 million as compared to USD 3.275bn in same period last year (down substantially by 79%). Moreover, remittances remained a key support for stabilization of external balance this year and continued on a rising trend in FY24, as monthly remittance averaged at USD 2.5bn compared to USD 2.3bn in FY23.

On account of resumption of inflows from multilateral and bilateral partners as well as continuation of IMF program, forex reserves recovered massively to USD 13.97bn at June end compared to USD 9.16bn at the end of last year. Improved macros resulted in stabilization of exchange rate this year which faced immense pressure last year. Going forward, PKR might depreciate at normal levels of 5%-6% on an annual basis as potential flows from friendly countries and fiscal consolidation will likely keep PKR slide in check.

Large Scale Manufacturing Index (LSMI) is on the rising trajectory with May 2024 index increased by 7.5% YoY. Further boost in economic activity is expected as monetary easing has already started and it is expected to continue going forward. GDP is anticipated to grow by 3.60% in FY25 respectively with Agriculture expected to continue to play a major role this year as well.

Real interest rates remain significantly positive even after a 100 bps cut in the latest MPC meeting. Monetary easing is expected to continue throughout the year as inflation is expected to average around 11%-12% in FY25. However, several factors need to be considered in determining quantum and speed of the rate cuts including budgetary pressures, PKR depreciation and any uptick in oil prices due to worsening of Middle East conflict and another round of electricity tariff hikes owing to reduce.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of July clocked in at 11.1% which decreased slightly compared to June 2024. Food & Non-Alcoholic beverages segment remained the major contributor to increase in monthly change. Overall, CPI also witnessed increasing trend on MoM basis. Major increased witnessed in some food items on MoM basis such as pulse gram and Milk products due to price normalization after sharp fall in previous month. Overall, Year-on-Year inflation remains near 24-month low marking the instance of positive real interest rate since December 2020 and open room for SBP to cut interest rate further going forward.

Recent monetary policy held at 29-July-2024 in which SBP reduced the policy rate by 100bps at 19.5%. Secondary market yield also witnessed declining trend this month and overall decreased by an average of 56bps while longer tenor yields declined by around 16bps during the month. The yields witnessed declining trend prior to monetary policy announcements as market started pricing in increase expectation of interest rate cuts due to positive indicators such as, considerable improvement in both inflation readings and external position as well as improving foreign exchange reserves.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions with a total target of PKR 300 billion against the maturity of PKR 457 billion. In the first auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 405 billion at a cut-off yield of 20.05%, 19.78% and 18.54% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the Second auctions, SBP accepted total bids worth PKR 433 billion at a cut-off yield of 19.49%, 19.29%, and 18.24% for 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month tenures respectively. In the PIB auction, bids worth Rs. 140.7 billion were accepted for 3-year and 5-year at cut-off yields of 16.25% and 15.30% respectively. However, no bids were received for 10, years, 15-years, 20-years & 30-years tenures.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to gradually decrease from its recent elevated levels and remained at level of 11% -12% on a consistent basis due to stability in currency along with favorable base effect. Monetary easing is expected to continue going forward potentially resulting in a reduction of 6%-8% in the policy rate over the next Fiscal year. However, concerns regarding inflationary reforms through the IMF program, volatility in oil prices and freight cost due to current Middle East conflict remain significant risk to our forecasted rate cuts this extent.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Continuing its ascent, the benchmark Index soared to a new zenith of 81,840 points on July 12, 2024, before closing the month at 77,887. This reflects a relatively flat performance compared to the closing level of 77,899 on June 30, 2024. The market retained a positive outlook due to several significant developments: Pakistan reached a staff-level agreement with the IMF on July 12, 2024; the State Bank of Pakistan continued with monetary easing with a 1% interest rate cut, bringing the current policy rate to 19.5%; and Fitch upgraded Pakistan’s long-term foreign currency issuer default rating to “CCC+” from “CCC.” Average daily trading volume increased by 6% month-over-month, reaching 186.2 million shares compared to 175.79 million shares the previous month.

Foreign investors maintained a significant presence with a net inflow of US$23.84 million this month, although down from the previous month's inflow of US$48.21 million. The IMF’s staff-level approval for a 37-month, US$7 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and announcement of a revenue-ambitious budget bolstered investor confidence in the country’s ongoing macroeconomic reforms. Foreign purchases were primarily focused on the Technology, Commercial Banks, and Power sectors.

During the month, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) opted to reduce the interest rate by 100 basis points, bringing the policy rate down to 19.5%. This move by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) was driven by lower inflation figures, elevated real interest rates, better reserves position, and manageable current account deficit. This 100 basis point reduction follows a 150 basis point cut implemented in the previous month's MPC meeting, which marked the first rate cut in four years.

The new government's robust commitment to economic reforms, adherence to the IMF program, and focus on fiscal consolidation have significantly bolstered investor confidence in both the economy and the stock market. Staff-level agreement with the IMF for a USD 7 billion program has been reached in current month, further strengthening the nation's macroeconomic position.

Looking ahead, inflation is anticipated to remain at lower levels, largely due to a higher base effect. However, the potential impact of rising utility tariffs and international.
