Fund Managers' Report April 2016

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Economic activity in the manufacturing sector continued to expand with large scale manufacturing registering a growth of 4.35% in the first eight months of the fiscal year vis-à-vis 2.37% in the corresponding period last year. Moreover, data released in April showed that the Purchasing Manufacturers Index was recorded at 63.44 for March 2016, as opposed to January’s reading of 64.54 and March 2015’s reading of 65.13. This showed that economic activity continued to expand in March. Going forward, the economy is expected to continue to receive impetus from improvements in energy availability, low input prices, and low cost of financing.

Inflation was recorded at 4.17% in April, the highest YoY growth since December 2014. The hike in CPI Index was mostly due to non-recurring spikes in house rent and education charges as well as rise in prices of non-perishable food items. Inflation is expected to remain subdued and fall within the level of 3-4% for the remainder of this calendar year. Threats to inflation include a recent rally in international crude oil prices that can have a lagged effect on local motor fuel costs. For May the Government has kept local stable; however, if the rally in international commodities continues pressure on local prices might also filter through. In addition, the month of Ramzan, in which a jump in food prices is usually witnessed, is set to fall in June.

The economy’s external position continued to remain at comfortable levels during the period. The exchange rate remained range-bound between PKR 105.4 to 105.8 per USD in the open market. Moreover, foreign exchange reserves slipped marginally from USD 20.9bn to USD 20.8bn during the month. A small surplus was posted in the current account, which brought the current account deficit to USD 1.6bn in 9MFY16 vs. USD 2.0bn in the corresponding period last year. Going forward higher textile exports on the back of uninterrupted gas supply to the sector are likely to improve the external position. However, threats remain, including diminishing growth rate of remittances, higher import bill following a rise in international oil prices, and ending of IMF’s programme in August 2016.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of April the yield curve remained stable at the shorter end and moved upwards for three and five year bonds. The interbank market anticipated an increase in borrowing requirements of the government and therefore most of the income funds across the industry faced the brunt of adverse PIB revaluation. Following the trend, market participation in the last T-bill auction of the month was witnessed at higher levels compared to previous cut off; however, the SBP rejected all bids therefore negating the idea that the government is under pressure with reference to its borrowing requirements.

The Government reduced coupons on PIBs in the range of 100-175bps in the month of April and the new coupons for 3-years, 5-years, and 10-years bond stand at 7.00%, 7.75%, and 8.75% respectively. Cut-off yields rose up significantly for 3-year instruments in April's auction, while they remained almost flat for 5 and 10 year bonds. Participation was mostly concentrated in 3 and 5 year bonds.

Despite an outlook of benign inflation, SBP is expected to maintain the policy rate at the current level to reflect a healthy real interest rate and to maintain a stable exchange rate. In future, slipping of crude oil prices may build a case for another cut.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 index gained over 1,500 points (+4.8%) during April in continuation of the rally that started at the end of February. Biggest contributors to the index’s gain were Oil and Gas stocks and Banks, while certain Food, Pharmaceutical, Fertilizer, and Power Sector stocks restrained the index. Foreign investors remained net sellers during the month once again with a cumulative net sell of USD 18.1m as opposed to USD 11.3m sale in March 2016. Foreign investors mostly disinvested from the Commercial Banks and Fertilizer Sectors.

The gains in the market during April were mostly attributable to Oil and Gas E&P stocks, which started rallying due to a surge in international crude oil prices. These prices in turn rose because of indication by the International Energy Agency that the current global oil surplus will reduce substantially in the second half of this year. Failure of OPEC and non-OPEC producers to reach an oil output freeze had only a very short-lived impact on crude oil prices.

The index was further helped by the three big private banks that had previously reached attractive levels and that are under consideration to be included in MSCI’s Emerging Market Index should Pakistan be classified as an Emerging Market in June. Expectations of higher inflation, and consequently ending of monetary easing cycle, also contributed to positive sentiment in these stocks. Moreover, posting of positive earnings surprises by the Attock Group Companies, International Steel, Gul Ahmed Textile Mills, Nishat Mills, and Packages, among others, led to strong rallies in these stocks.

MSCI’s upcoming reclassification review of Pakistan as an Emerging Market, and the federal budget are expected to determine the direction of the market throughout the months of May and June.
