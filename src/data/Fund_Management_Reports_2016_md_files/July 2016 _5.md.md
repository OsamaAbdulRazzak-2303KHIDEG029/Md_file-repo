Fund Managers' Report July 2016

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy grew by 4.71% in FY16, the highest rate in the past eight years. This growth was mainly driven by industrial sector, including automobiles, fertilizers, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, rubber, and cement. Towards the end of FY16 and start of FY17 greater energy availability due to continual import of LNG helped industries, especially fertilizers and textiles. Going forward this increased energy availability along with CPEC and other development projects are expected to thrust the economy forward. Threats to growth are likely to stem from the stability in the foreign exchange market that can negatively impact export competitiveness.

Inflation spiked up to 4.1% in July 2016, compared to 3.2% in June 2016. The rise in CPI was mostly attributable to house rent as well as food and beverages’ prices. The SBP-IBA consumer confidence index for July shows that consumers expect higher inflation for the coming months than they previously did. However, (i) continuation of the recent slippage in crude oil prices due to supply glut worries in the US, (ii) sluggish global demand, (iii) possible impact of Brexit on global commodity prices, and (iv) excess domestic food stock can keep inflation subdued.

Like the second half of FY16, the exchange rate remained stable in July 2016. During FY16, low exports and slowing growth of remittances undermined the benefit from low international crude oil prices. Going forward, threats to the external position stem from (i) slowing down of official transfers, especially after conclusion of the IMF program in September, 2016, (ii) slowing growth rate of remittances, and (iii) dip in export proceeds.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

Secondary market yields reduced by 15-20bps over the longer term and 10-13bps across medium term during the month of July as most of the market players feared a further rate cut in the monetary policy announcement scheduled for the end of the month. The Central Bank, however, decided to not change its policy rate due to potential upward pressures on consumer prices through (i) increased economic activity, (ii) possible rise in gas tariff, (iii) fiscal slippages, and (iv) possible supply disruptions. Going forward, interest rates are expected to remain stable throughout the first half of FY17 and a rate hike is expected towards the end of the fiscal year.

During the month of July around 27% of outstanding PIBs worth PKR 1.3 trillion matured. In the absence of appetite from the Government for longer term borrowing, most of the Banks ended up parking this liquidity in short-term instruments (TBills). Yields came off by 20-22bps in the PIB auction held in July.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The market continued its bull run for a sixth straight month to rise by 1,745 points (+4.6%) in July 2016. Continuation of euphoria related to Pakistan’s upcoming inclusion in MSCI’s Emerging Market Index was the major reason for the positive sentiment, coupled with rise in focus on certain side-board items. Positive net foreign investment in the market for a third consecutive month also helped the bullish sentiment.

Top performers during the month included INDU, SNGP, NCL, HASCOL, LUCK, NRL, and HCAR. Stocks that declined in value included blue-chips like FFC, KAPCO, OGDC and EFOODS. Oil and Gas E&P stocks performed particularly poorly during the month on the back of weak crude oil prices, which in turn declined due to increase in US crude production in July, the first such month since January. Ample US crude supplies as the summer driving season approached its end was another reason for the dip in prices.

The index is expected to face resistance near the 40,000 psychological level and to consolidate if the level is broken. Our outlook for the long-term, however, remains upbeat due to Pakistan’s upcoming reclassification as an emerging market, and an expected growth spurt driven by investments and activities related to CPEC and PSDP as well as enhanced energy availability.
