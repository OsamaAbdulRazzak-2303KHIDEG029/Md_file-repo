Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report April 2018

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The Government has estimated GDP growth of 5.79% in FY18, which is the highest in thirteen years. Major contribution has come from the Services Sector, which the Government estimates to have grown by 6.43%. Meanwhile, the Industrial Sector is estimated to have grown by 5.80%, led by Construction Sub-sector’s growth of 9.13% and Manufacturing’s growth of 6.24%. Agricultural Sector is estimated to have grown by 3.81%, with highest growth coming from the Cotton Ginning Sub-sector. The Government is targeting an even higher growth rate of 6.20% for FY19, which it foresees as achievable given greater energy availability, low cost of borrowing, and PKR depreciation (which shall boost exports).

However, the Federal Government’s planned expenditure for development has been reduced by 14.0% for FY19, which might somewhat restrain economic growth. It is pertinent to mention here that in its recently released report on regional outlook, IMF has projected Pakistan’s economic growth to be only 4.7% for FY19. Pressures on the external front have continued, with foreign exchange reserves now down to USD 17.1bn. To boost reserves the Government had planned on borrowing USD 1bn from China and the transaction materialized which gave boost to the country’s FX reserves. Further support for Pakistan’s reserve position is expected to come from a rise in exports following PKR depreciation. Exports have been on a mostly upwards trajectory since late last year, and during March they surged by 11.7% MoM. Meanwhile, it is not expected that Pakistan will take a drastic step out of desperation to boost reserves, as the Finance Minister has ruled out a return to the IMF anytime soon.

Inflation has risen slightly in April, with CPI growth recorded at 3.68% versus 3.25% in March. Given the rise in domestic fuel prices following the gains in international crude oil prices, inflation is expected to continue to trend slightly upwards in the coming months. Due to the outlook on inflation and external position, ideally speaking, a 25-50 bps hike in policy rate in the upcoming monetary policy announcement scheduled for the end of May cannot be ruled out. However, the outcome of the MPS may be politically motivated as this is the last announcement under this government and the government may not want to take any unpopular policy decisions at this stage.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, market remained relatively stable with majority of the activity remained concentrated in T-bills maturing under 3-months tenure. Cumulatively, the central bank was able to fetch approximately PKR 3.3 trillion from the two T-bills auctions held during the month. With the expectation of increase in discount rate in upcoming monetary policy which is due at the end of the next month built into the system, market participants participated at higher yields, as a result cutoff for 3M and 6M stood at 6.25% and 6.35% respectively with no participation witnessed in 12M T-bill. After rejecting the bond auctions for consecutive eight months, market participants renewed their interest in longer tenure bonds and the central bank was able to fetch a decent amount of bids in 5Year (100M) and 10Year (25.4M). Compared to the last cutoff yields in July’17, the yields are up by 56-113 bps with majority of the increase witnessed in 5 Years. The cutoffs for 3, 5 and 10 Year stood at 7.20%, 8.03% and 8.50% respectively. This shift in the yield curve indicates expectation of rate hike coupled with deteriorating macro-economic conditions and expectation of increase in inflation rate in the medium term which coincides with the OPEC’s indication of oil prices at USD 80/bbl.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index remained flattish during the month of April, losing -0.2% MoM. Average daily turnover during the month of Apr’18 improved by 41.5% MoM to 104 mn compared to only 73.6mn in Mar’18. Foreign Investors remained net sellers during the month, selling equities worth USD 17.42mn. Cement and Bank stocks were the major contributors to the decline mostly due to negative earnings surprises and fears of detrimental tax measures in the Federal Budget ahead of its announcement. On the other hand, Fertilizers supported the index as the dynamics of the sector continued to improve, as the urea inventory cleared and international urea prices remained firm. Top Banks posted earnings surprises as they booked a one-off pension charge. HBL contributed the most losses to the index as it posted an EPS of only PKR 2.70 in 1Q CY18 against street consensus expectations of PKR 5.07. Similarly, UBL negatively surprised investors by taking a big hit of PKR 6.4bn pertaining to its pension case. Fears that Super Tax will continue kept the Banking Sector bearish ahead of the budget announcement. The FY19 budget extended the Super Tax but with a phasing out plan was also introduced. Super tax will now continue till FY20, going down by 1% each year for both banks and corporations. Similar to the Banking Sector, fears that FED on cement will be raised kept investor sentiments in the Cement sector low. Investors’ fears were materialized in the Budget announcement towards the end of the month, when the Government raised FED on cement to PKR 75/bag from PKR 62.5/bag. Moreover, the Government announced a 20% reduction in Federal PSDP for FY19, which dented sentiments towards the end of the month. The Budget has taken several positive measures too that we expect will boost the market going forward. These measures include (i) reduction of corporate tax rate to 25% by 2023 in a staggered manner, (ii) removal of tax on bonus shares, (iii) extension in cut-off date for availing tax credit (u/s 65B, 65D and 65E of Income Tax Ordinance, 2001) till FY21, (iv) reduction in tax on dividend given by REITs, (v) enhancement of limit on tax credit on investments in shares/sukuks, and (vi) change of tax on stock brokers to adjustable from full and final. Moreover, the market is expected to be driven by politics ahead of the General Elections in Aug’18.
