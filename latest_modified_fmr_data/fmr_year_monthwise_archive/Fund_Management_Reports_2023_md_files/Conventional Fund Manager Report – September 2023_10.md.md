Fund Managers' Report September 2023

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On the local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3 -12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps.

Foreign exchange reserves increased to US$13.17bn at end of September, compared to US$12.60bn at the end of last month. PKR appreciated during the month by 6.2% to close at the level of 287.74, as the stern administrative actions taken by the caretaker setup against unlawful foreign exchange dealers and hoarders in commodity markets started to pay results.

Inflation for the month of September clocked at 31.4%. Food and Transport remained the major contributors to the monthly change. Perishable food prices continued to increase in response to increase in freight charges. Increased petrol prices contributed to increase in the Transport segment.

Going forward, inflation is expected to remain at elevated levels of late 20s till January 2024, before falling below 20% in last quarter of the current fiscal year. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

SBP held two T-Bill auctions during the month of September, with a target of PKR 4,200 billion against the maturity of PKR 4,491 billion. In the first auction, amount of PKR 1,256 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 24.50%, 24.79% and 25.07% for 3-month, 6-month and 12 months’ tenure respectively. In the second auction, an amount of around PKR 2,250 billion was accepted at cut-off yields of 22.79%, 22.80% and 22.90% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures respectively.

The Central Bank conducted a monetary policy meeting on September 14, 2023, in which the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) decided to maintain the policy rate at 22%, citing downward trajectory of inflation going forward, implying a significant level of positive real interest rates.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 posted a positive return of 2.73% during the month of September to close at a level of 46,232.59 points. The average daily volume decreased by 54% on MoM basis as it clocked at 76mn compared to previous month’s level of 164.8mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$9mn compared to a net inflow of US$12.87mn in August, where the majority of selling was seen in cement, banks, and fertilizer.
