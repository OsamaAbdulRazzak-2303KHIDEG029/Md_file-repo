Fund Managers' Report September 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economy continued its recovery in September, in contrast to last month in which unusually heavy rainfall hampered activities. Current Account registered a surplus of US$ 297mn for August’20 compared to a deficit of US$ 601 mn in August’19. For 2MFY20, the surplus is USD 805 mn as compared to a deficit of USD 1214 mn in SPLY. The external account situation has improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation. Exports during August ’20 showed a decrease of 19% YoY mainly due to fall in demand from the importing countries as a result of the pandemic. Foreign remittances depicted surprising increase of 24% YoY for August’20, despite the fact that COVID-19 has hurt the incomes of Expatriates across the globe.

Foreign exchange reserves decreased by ~US$ 373 mn during the month to close at US$ 19.5 bn as of 25 September, 2020, mainly due to debt repayments. Nevertheless, PKR appreciated by 0.3% against USD during the month. Expected monetary assistance from multilateral lending institutions and inflows through Roshan Pakistan Savings accounts should provide further support to the Rupee in next few months.

CPI clocked in at a level of 9% for the month of September’20 which was higher than market consensus. The level of MoM Inflation was witnessed due to increase in food prices amid supply disruptions. We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months mainly due to a high base effect. In light of falling inflation forecasts, SBP kept policy rate unchanged at 7 percent to continue the momentum of economic recovery, while raised its inflation forecasts to 7-9%.

The Government is expecting a contraction of 0.4% in GDP for FY20 as disclosed in the latest Pakistan Economic Survey. Going forward, the government has set a GDP Growth target of 2.1% in FY21 whereas the IMF is forecasting growth to remain restricted to 1% due to the continuing effects of the pandemic. Meanwhile, large scale manufacturing staged a rebound in July’20 taking relevant index up by 5% YoY. Top performing categories in the LSM bucket for Jul’2020 include: non-metallic mineral products; food, beverages & tobacco; pharmaceuticals; coke & petroleum products and paper & board.

The Government has allowed marriage halls and schools to re-open, removing last of the restrictions in place due to COVID-19. The number of daily new cases is still under 1,000 whereas active cases have increased to nearly 9,000 from a low of 6,000 earlier. Therefore, a second wave of infections cannot be ruled out.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the reviewed month, SBP announced the monetary policy for the next two months. As expected the policy rate was maintained at 7% as Monetary policy Committee (MPC) was of the view that the stance to the monetary policy remained appropriate to provide the needed support to the emerging recovery. However, the inflation expectations were slightly risen owing to the supply side shocks in food prices. Likewise, the head line inflation for the month increased to 9.04%, owing to the hefty rise in prices of food items.

Secondary market witnessed a sharp rise in yields across all tenors. Heavy selling was witnessed from mutual funds in short term T-bills in order to make quarter end crossing placements. While rebound in international oil prices strained the market participants to take heavy bets in longer duration instruments.

SBP conducted Treasury bill auctions twice during the month. Total cumulative realized amount in both the auctions was PKR 853.5bn. Cut off yields stood at 7.1399%, 7.18% and 7.3090% for 3, 6 and 12 months tenor respectively.

In a PIB auction held during the month, SBP accepted a cumulative amount of PKR 2.74 billion against the total participation of PKR 76.7 billion. The cut-off for 3-year, 5-year and 10-year tenors stood at 8.20%, 8.45%, 8.99% respectively. Auction for floating rate bond also held twice during the month. Total participation was PKR 192.5bn against the total target of PKR 110bn. SBP accepted around PKR 136.8 billion. The cut-off prices of 3-year/5-year/10-year stood at 100.3409/100.3456/100.0365 respectively.

So far, the economy has shown early signs of recovery post COVID pandemic, as the ease in lockdowns and growth in exports have boded well to increase confidence of the businesses. However, rise in inflation is the major point of concern and challenge for the monetary authorities to stimulate the economy in order to continue the growth momentum. Under current circumstances, we will closely monitor market movements in the near term and optimize portfolio allocations accordingly in order to stabilize funds’ performance.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index took a breather and posted a negative return of 1.31% in the month of September 2020 to close at 40,571 points, after posting positive returns for 3 consecutive months. The average daily turnover saw a rise of 21% on MoM basis as it clocked at 355mn in September, compared to previous month’s level of 292mn.

Foreigners remained net sellers this month, as the net foreign outflow during September'2020 amounted to US$33.30mn as compared to a net inflow of US$6.85mn in August’2020, where the selling was concentrated in Commercial Banks (US$ 15.29mn) and Cements (US$ 9.68mn).

Key developments during the month included a) investigation of recent hike in cement bag price by Competition Commission of Pakistan led to negative sentiment in the sector as it contributed negatively to the index by 37 points, b) arrest of famous personality in the opposition party by NAB and anti-government speeches added to the overall political noise and contributed negatively to the market, c) SBP maintained the policy rate to provide stimulus to the economy despite rising inflationary pressures caused SBP to revise inflation target for the year in the range of 7%-9%.

Number of daily coronavirus cases stood in the range of 400 to 700 during the month of September, rising a little as the previous month closed at around 300 cases on a daily basis. There are concerns about cases increasing due to change in weather going forward, however, the slight increase in cases witnessed this month can be attributed to increase in number of tests as infection ratio largely remained the same. Number of recovered patients as at month end stood at 297k compared to 281k in the last month. This resulted in a decline in active cases from 9k in the previous month end to 8.8k during this month.

On a monthly basis, Fertilizer sector contributed largest to the upside of KSE-100 index with 172 points mainly because of ongoing talks of price increase in urea prices to pass on the effect of GIDC to end consumers, followed by Food and Personal care products with 57 points due to increased profitability posted in recent result season. On the contrary, Oil and Gas Exploration contributed negatively to the index the most by 367 points followed by Power Generation with 170 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals, expectations of rising Covid-19 infections & its impact on business operations, and any developments on political front will determine market direction in the near term.
