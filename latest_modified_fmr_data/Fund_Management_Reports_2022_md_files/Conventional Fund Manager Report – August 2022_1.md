Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited Fund Managers' Report August 2022

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Globally, the economic situation is still challenging following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, wherein the commodity prices are hovering around historic high levels. On local front, the higher commodity prices would bring inflationary burdens and keep external account under pressure. Following the removal of subsidies on petroleum products and increase in prices by more than PKR 100, inflation for the month of Jun’22 clocked at 21.32% (highest in 14 years). Inflation is also driven by higher food prices and an uptick in housing index. Due to higher NCPI levels, secondary market yields across 3-12 months’ tenor climbed by an average of 64bps. The heavy rainfalls and floods have resulted in massive damage to major crops and cultivable land. The output of cotton, rice and maize crops will be affected from the flood and going to impact the agriculture growth in FY23. According to different reports and our assessment, the flood has caused devastation of around $10bn.

On external front, the Current Account Deficit for the month of May-2022 clocked at US$1.4bn relative to a deficit of US$640mn in same period last year, solely attributable to higher imports. Cumulatively, current account deficit registered at US$15.2bn in 11MFY22 compared to a deficit of US$1.2bn last year. In 11MFY22, petroleum group imports witnessed growth of 99%YoY to USD19.8bn (27%YoY in volumetric terms). Reduction in energy and major commodity prices will be a real boost for Pakistan which will ultimately result in reduction in the import bill and consequently Current Account deficit. Moreover, this will also put less pressure on FX reserve.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD14.2bn in mid Jun’22 (lowest level since Jul-19). Due to draining foreign exchange reserves and uncertainty on foreign inflows, PKR/USD parity touched an all-time peak level of PKR211.9/USD; later it recovered to PKR204.8/USD by end of the month on back of proceeds received from China Development Bank. Resultantly, foreign exchange reserves increased to USD16.2bn.

Furthermore, the persistent rise in imports and in absence of foreign flows, foreign exchange reserves dropped to USD13.4bn by end of August (lowest level since Jul-19). The incumbent government has recently raised domestic petroleum prices in order to reduce burden on fiscal account and to revive the stalled IMF program. Inflation is expected to remain elevated for next 6-7 months fueled by removal of subsidy on petroleum products and increase in utility tariffs. However, the recent slump in international oil prices would help in curtailing the import bill and ease pressure on external account.

IMF completed staff level agreement for 7th and 8th quarterly reviews of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and approved immediate disbursement of $1.1Bn to Pakistan. IMF’s release of the tranche would also catalyze multilateral and bilateral lending. The IMF had estimated Pakistan’s financing needs during FY23 to be about $34Bn. Whereas, Pakistan has secured financing arrangements of $38Bn.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of August, the Central Bank decided to maintain policy rate at 15 percent. The MPC felt that the recent steps taken by the Government to curtail imports and a cumulative hike of 800bps since last year is enough to moderate demand for the near future and improve the external position going forward.

Inflation for the month of August clocked in at 27.26% YoY, mainly due to surge in Food prices and Electricity tariffs, contributing 69% of the overall MoM change of 2.45%.

Secondary market yields for short term instruments up to 3 months increased by an average of 25bps, while yields for 3 to 12 months increased by an average of 11bps. For longer tenors, yield for 5 and 10 years decreased by 39bps and 38bps respectively.

SBP held two T-Bill auctions in the month of August with a target of PKR 1,300 billion compared to maturity of PKR 1,082 billion. In the first T-Bill auction, an amount of around PKR 442 billion was accepted, while cut-off yields stood at 15.75%, 15.80% and 15.94% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures. In the second T-Bill auction, an amount of PKR 779 billion was accepted at the same cut-off yield of 15.79%, 15.85% and 15.94% for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month tenures, respectively.

In the PIB auction, bids around PKR 300 billion were realized for 3-years and 5-years tenures at cut-off yield of 13.95% and 13.40% whereas bids for 10-years were rejected and no bids for 15-years, 20-years and 30-years were received.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

Benchmark index i.e. KSE-100 fell by 3.57% during the month of June to close at 41,540.83 points. The average daily volume decreased by 16.3% on MoM basis as it clocked at 96.99mn compared to previous month’s level of 115.88mn. Foreigners remained net sellers, as the net foreign outflow during the current month amounted to US$12.48mn compared to a net outflow of US$8.82mn in May, where the buying was concentrated in Technology and Communication (US$4.15mn) while there was net selling in Commercial Banks amounting to US$8.69mn.

Key developments during the month include a) Approval of Federal Budget by National Assembly, wherein, FBR revenue target was increased to PKR 7.5trn (up 23%) encompassing high taxes on corporates and real estate; b) Hike in petroleum prices including Petroleum Development levy to restart the stalled IMF program; and c) PKR hit new low against USD of 211.9 due to continued pressure on forex reserves on account of high CAD and external debt repayments.

Government has carried out the vaccination drive extraordinarily well, as 62% of the total population has now received at least one shot, while 35% of the total population is below the age of 14 years and vaccine drive is yet to start for children aged below 12 years. Meanwhile, COVID-19 active cases increased substantially by 87% to close at 6.32k at end of the month, compared to 3.38k at the end of last month.

On a monthly basis, Oil & Gas Marketing companies contributed the most to the index i.e. 92 points on rumours of circular debt resolution by the Government and increase in gas prices. On the contrary, Banks contributed negatively to the index the most by 1042 points due to excess taxation on the sector imposed in FY23 budget.

Macroeconomic fundamentals particularly CAD and inflation will determine market direction in the near term.
