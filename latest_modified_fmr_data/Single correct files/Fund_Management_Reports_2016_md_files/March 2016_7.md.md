March 2016

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Inflation for the month of March was reported at 3.94% YoY. Compared to February 2016, CPI grew by 0.15% in March, despite a dip in motor fuel prices, due to the hike in prices of perishable food items. Going forward inflation is expected to remain subdued as the low base effect ends and commodity prices remain downward sticky. A risk to this thesis is possible agreement between OPEC and Non-OPEC producers over crude oil output freeze, which can remove the pressure that international crude oil prices currently face. Consumers, however, do not foresee a rise in prices, as is evident from the SBP-IBA Consumer Confidence Survey of March. The survey showed that respondents expect an even further decline in overall price levels, especially energy inflation, compared to the last survey.

The external position of Pakistan's economy remained stable during the quarter, with the exchange rate hovering between PKR 104-105 per USD. Foreign exchange reserves were also steady during the quarter, but currently stand below the high they reached in December 2015. A delay in rate hike by the US's Federal Reserve is likely to keep exchange rates stable in the medium term; however, risks remain, including the ending of purchases from IMF in August this year, low exports and declining growth of remittances.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

In line with the trend witnessed in the first two months of the quarter, secondary market yields for longer-tenor bonds dipped more than those for shorter tenor instruments in March. The quantum of the reduction, however, was lower in March compared to January and February. In the primary market, cut-off yields continued to taper off on account of persistent demand from institutional investors, in addition to the fact that the upcoming issues will carry lower coupons. Lowering of the longer-end of the yield curve can also be attributed to the notion that market participants are shifting their focus from shorter tenor bonds to relatively longer tenor bonds as inflation is expected to remain lower for longer.

Despite an outlook of subdued inflation in the coming months, SBP could very well maintain the policy rate at current level to prevent unnecessary pressure on Pak Rupee and maintain a healthy real interest rate. Although risks to the exchange rate in the wake of upcoming US rate hikes are likely to discourage further monetary easing, a surprise rate cut over remaining year cannot be completely ruled out. Risks to our outlook emanate from possibly higher crude oil prices should there be a successful agreement between OPEC and non-OPEC members to freeze/reduce oil output.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index made a sharp recovery in the month of March, and jumped by over 1,700 points (+5.6%) giving investors an opportunity to reverse the losses made in the first two months of the quarter. The Index gained around 300 points (+1.0%) during 1QCY16 to close at just above the psychological level of 33,000. Reasons for the recovery in March included a sharp rise in crude oil prices and strong growth in exports of Cement producers. Moreover, Foreign Portfolio outflows remained lower during the month compared to January and February, thereby reducing the negative sentiment witnessed in the earlier part of the year.

Among the best performers in the local bourse during the month were Sugar and Allied Industries, Cements, Oil and Gas, and Pharmaceutical Sectors. The Cements Sector performed well due to strong growth in cement dispatches, especially exports. At the same time, the Oil and Gas Sector performed well on the back of a rise in crude oil prices, which in turn resulted from expectations of crude oil output freeze. Auto Sector underperformed the market due to the release of a less than favorable Auto Policy, which held few benefits for existing players and encouraged new entrants in the industry.

Going forward we expect increased excitement related to Pakistan’s possible inclusion in MSCI’s Emerging Markets’ Index ahead of the annual market classification review in June. The positive sentiment for reclassification to EM status, however, is likely to be somewhat countered by the upcoming announcement of the FY17 Federal Budget and the uncertainty associated with it.
