January 2016

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Inflation continued to trend upwards in the month of January, albeit only very gradually, with low crude oil prices countering most of the low base effect. CPI growth rate was recorded at 3.32% during the month, vis-à-vis 3.19% in December 2015 and 2.73% in November 2015. House rent helped push up inflation while perishable food items and motor fuel prices kept it tame. Due to the low base effect, inflation is expected to be above 4% for the next two months (February and March).

On external front the economy’s position has continued to strengthen, with forex reserves now standing at USD 20.5bn and current account deficit at a low USD 1.3bn in Jul-Dec FY16 compared to USD 2.5bn in the corresponding period last year. The exchange rate too has been fairly stable since slipping in December 2015, when the US Fed’s rate hike was preceded by strengthening of the USD against major currencies.

However, threats to the external position, and resultantly the exchange rate remain. These threats include slowing down of the growth rate of remittances and fall in exports. Supports for the external position include a decline in oil import bill and privatization proceeds.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The State Bank kept the target policy rate unchanged at 6% for the next two months in its policy announcement on January 30, 2016. The justification for the decision was that the low base effect could raise inflation in the coming months. At the same time, however, SBP warned that continuation of global oil price downtrend and excess domestic food stocks (especially those of wheat, rice and sugar) could exert downward pressure on inflation.

Equity Market

In September, 2013, the KSE100 lost 1.5% or 328 points to breach the 22,000 points mark on the back on unexpected turn of events on the economic front. The continued Both primary and secondary market yields came off during the month due to fears of inflation remaining lower for longer in the wake FIPI flow, approval of fresh IMF loan under EFF drove the KSE100 index through better part of the month. The market rallied approx. 7% on the back of investor optimism of low crude oil prices, which in turn raised fears of a discount rate cut. Resultantly, heavy participation was seen in the T-bill auction, hence cut-offs inched down by 17bps, 18bps and 16bps for 3m, 6m and 12m treasuries respectively. Similarly, significant participation of PKR 355bn was seen in the PIB auction, against which the government accepted PKR 132bn. Cut-off yields for 3Y, 5Y and 10Y PIBs came off by 52bps, 44bps and 25bps respectively in the auction. Despite unchanged policy rate announcement, yields have remained low as demand for Government bonds has persisted.

The record profitability and strong payout announcements by DGKC, LUCK and NML also failed to keep the investor interest intact. Going forward, we expect the market to stay range bound in absence of any strong positive triggers. The expected interest rate hike will also limit the market movement with selective buying recommended in Cements, Textiles and IPPs.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

After The KSE-100 index lost over 1,500 points in the month of January mostly due to (i) global equity markets’ rout, (ii) slippage in crude oil prices and (iii) heightening of investigations against brokers. These factors led to the index plunging in the first half of the month and then remaining mostly range-bound later.

The major reason behind the global equity markets’ rout was a series of poor economic numbers and news from China, including the regulators’ failed attempt at arresting the stock market’s decline by imposing, and subsequently suspending, a market circuit breaker mechanism. The CSI-300 declined by 21% while Hang Seng was down by 10% during the month. Given the global equity market’s rout, it was unsurprising that Pakistan's foreign investors’ portfolio investments saw an outflow of USD 50m in January. To put this amount in perspective, the total FIPI outflow was USD 315m, or an average of USD 26m per month, in CY15.

The index was weighed down chiefly by commercial banks, oil and gas and fertilizer companies. These sectors performed poorly during the month due to the decline in crude oil and commodity prices and their implication for inflation and interest rates.

The market’s direction in February is likely to be determined by (i) the earnings season, (ii) finalization of an LNG agreement with Qatar and (iii) any developments on OPEC and non-OPEC producers’ agreement on measures to support crude oil prices.
