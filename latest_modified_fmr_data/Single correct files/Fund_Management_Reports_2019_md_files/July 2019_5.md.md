Fund Managers' Report July 2019

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Large scale manufacturing remained subdued in May taking 11MFY19 relevant index down by 3.50% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across all sectors with food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, iron and steel products and autos leading the decline. Inflation for the month of Jul’19 clocked in at 10.34% due to rise in utility tariffs coupled with rising petrol prices. Rupee remained stable throughout the month and maintained its level.

Pakistan seems to be in low GDP growth phase where FY19 GDP growth is estimated to hover around 3.3%, but will fall further in FY20 at 2.4%, according to IMF estimates. Fiscal position remained worrisome, however, foreign exchange reserves increased by ~USD 600mn during the month to close at USD 15bn as of June 28, 2019. This was on the back of receipt of the first tranche of USD 990mn from the IMF. The reserves will witness a spike going forward as lending from other development institutions follow the bailout. Current Account deficit for the month of Jun'19 came in at USD 995mn down by 50% SPLY. This took FY19 CAD to USD 13.5bn. The situation is still precarious since the import cover has fallen to below 2 months. However, given the austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation, coupled with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July, the worst seems to be behind us, with further improvement expected in the current account. Exports during FY19 declined by a meagre 2%, however, we believe that an FTA with China can lead to a significant increase in textile exports for Pakistan. The trade deficit in FY19 stood at USD 28bn, showing a decline of 11%, while remittances went up by 10% to clock in at USD 21.8bn.

During the month, the SBP raised the discount rate by 100bps and signaled a peak of the monetary tightening, however, there can be adjustments in the discount rate dependent upon any inflationary shock going forward. Market activity seems to be depressed on the back of the CNIC condition imposed in the FY20 budget as retailers.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the month of July, money market remained relatively volatile owing to the expectation of rate hike which was due during the month. Market participants confined their positions in shorter duration instruments in order to hedge their position from any hawkish move from the central bank. In its latest monetary policy statement, SBP increased discount rate by 100bps, citing inflationary pressure in the coming months. The policy statement termed that adjustments related to exchange rate and interest rate from previously accumulated imbalances has taken place.

In the most recent T-bill auction SBP witnessed a total participation of PKR 901 billion out of which SBP accepted bids worth PKR 853 billion of which PKR 778 billion was witnessed in 3-Months, 29 billion in 6-Months and 45 billion in 12-Months. Cutoffs for 3-month, 6-month and 12-month were 13.75%, 13.95% and 14.24% respectively. Auction for fixed bonds witnessed an overwhelming response; the auction had a maturity of PKR 343 billion against a target of PKR 100 billion. SBP witnessed a total participation of PKR 699 billion out which PKR 120 billion in 3 year, PKR 55 billion in 5 year and PKR 25 billion in 10 year were accepted at 14.25%, 13.80% and 13.55% respectively. Auction for floating bond witnessed a total participation of PKR 128 billion out of which PKR 84 billion was accepted at a cutoff rate of 75 bps over benchmark. Going forward, any unanticipated increase in inflation that adversely affect the outlook may lead to further modest tightening.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index closed negative for sixth consecutive month in July, closing 5% down at 31,938 points. Average daily turnover in July 2019 came in at 61.7mn which was markedly inferior to previous month’s level of 98.8mn. During July, the net foreign inflow amounted to US$ 30.4mn compared to a net foreign outflow of US$ 4.9mn in the previous month. Foreign investors remained net buyers in cements (US$ 13.1mn) and cements (US$ 12.4mn) while they remained net sellers in Oil and Gas exploration companies (US$ 3.8mn) and fertilizers (US$ 2.7mn).

At the beginning of the month, the IMF board ratified the Extended Finance Facility worth $6.2bn for Pakistan. However, index remained under pressure during the month as concerns regarding weakening economy, precarious external reserves position and persistent current account deficit weighed down on the investor sentiments. Also, the government continued meetings with various stakeholders regarding the measures taken in FY20 budget regarding increase in tax collection (a record target of PKR 5.5tn has been set) and discouraging the informal economy. Due to these measures it is anticipated that economic growth will likely slowdown in the upcoming year which further dampened investor sentiment for equities investments.

On a monthly basis, power generation and distribution contributed the largest to the decline with 278 points, due to concerns regarding circular debt and lack of payouts, followed by oil and gas exploration sector with 233 points. Cement companies followed suit contributing 191 points to the decline due to shrinking industry volumes and margins. Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals and companies’ quarterly results are expected to determine the market direction.
