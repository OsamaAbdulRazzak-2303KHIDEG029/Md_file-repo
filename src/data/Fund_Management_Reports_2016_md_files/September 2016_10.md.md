## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

The month was marked by the successful conclusion of IMF’s program as the IMF approved its 12th and final tranche to Pakistan and released USD 102mn. The economy remained stable throughout Sept-16 with almost all macroeconomic indicators moving towards economic growth. CPI inflation for Sept-2016 remained restrained and stood at 3.88% YoY (increase of 0.2% MoM) while food prices remained slightly lower than expected, it was the MoM hike in Education (+2.4%) and Health (+1.4%) index which raised the overall inflation for the month. The month was also noted for SBP’s bi-monthly Monetary Policy in which the central bank opted to keep interest rates unchanged on the basis of a challenging external account scenario and slightly higher inflation going forwards. Core inflation NFNE (Non Food Non Energy) increased MoM 0.3% to stand at 4.8% YoY. Inflation for FY17 can be expected to remain around 4.25% - 4.50%, indicating stability in interest rates at least till the end of FY17. Additionally, China Development Bank also released USD 700mn on account of GoP inflows, pushing Pakistan’s foreign reserves to their all-time high level of USD 23.42bn. However, this reserve increase resulted into 0.2% Rupee appreciation against the USD which raises some concerns over export competitiveness of the country in the short term as regional currencies continue to depreciate. Lower international oil prices continued to exert pressure on remittances from oil-producing countries, causing worker’s remittances to fall by 3% YoY to USD 3.09bn during 2-month of FY17. However, overall outlook remains positive especially in the background of fast-track work on China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The SBP recently released the monetary policy statement where the discount rate was maintained at 6.25%. During the period SBP conducted two T-Bill and one PIB auctions. The completion of the IMF program along with the strong reserve position (USD 23.4bn) has enabled the central bank to dictate the rates on offer. This is objectively evident from the bid cover ratio which jumped from 1.42 (9th Sept-2016) to 2.96 in the last auction. SBP maintained the yield across all the tenors 3M at 5.8571%, 6M at 5.9046% and 12M at 5.9148%. The total target amount was PKR 200 bn and realized amount of PKR 114 bn.

The government raised PKR 219.15 billion in an auction of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) against the pre-auction target of PKR 100 billion, according to the results issued by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in mid-September. The central bank accepted bids worth PKR 219.2 billion in the auction for the sale of 3yr, 5yr and 10 yr maturities. The central bank received total offers worth PKR 295.8 billion. Cutoff yield in the three maturities have witnessed marginal decline which have have come down to 6.1970%, 6.7010% and 7.7995%, in 3-years, 5-years, and 10-years, respectively.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

The KSE-100 Index went up by 1.8% MoM, to close at a historic high of 40,542 points in Sept-2016. The market has increased by 24% CYTD and 10% since the MSCI upgrade that was announced in June. The total volume for the month increased by a substantial 117% MoM, however value traded rose only by 32% MoM, as majority of volume was witnessed in small cap stocks. FIPI outflow during the month was USD 41 mn, led by cements and foods taking total CYTD outflow to USD 79 mn. Top performers during the month included MCB and and key Auto sector stocks with foreign and local buying in the banking sector. The Monetary Policy Committee decided to keep discount rate unchanged at 6.25% in its latest meeting for the next two months which built up expectations of the discount rate bottoming out here. Additionally, launch of new variants in both Fortuner and Hilux category brought positive sentiment in Indus Motor. During the month, sectors that outperformed the benchmark KSE-100 were Automobile, Engineering and Electronic and Electric goods. Automobile Assemblers performed well due to their new models, On the other hand, stocks that contributed the most to drag the index down included blue-chips like HUBC, FFC, DGKC, ENGRO, and DAWH. All major sectors E&P, Cement and Banks remained flat during the month.
