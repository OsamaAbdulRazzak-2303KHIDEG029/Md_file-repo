Fund Managers' Report April 2020

## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan suffered from the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic throughout April, denting the fragile path towards an economic recovery. Both Federal and Provincial governments continued with the policy of lockdown during the month which hampered economic activities across the country. However, many export-oriented industries were allowed to resume operations on a limited scale with strict SOP’s in place to control the spread of infections.

Pakistan’s GDP growth rate that clocked in at 3.3% in FY19, was anticipated to fall to 2.4% in FY20, according to IMF estimates. However, the IMF has now revised the growth outlook to -1.5% in FY20 due to the coronavirus situation, marking the first possible economic contraction in the county since 1952. Large scale manufacturing remained depressed in 8MFY20 taking relevant index down by 3% YoY. The shrinkage in demand was witnessed across most sectors with automobiles, pharmaceuticals, petroleum, iron and steel products leading the decline.

Foreign exchange reserves increased by ~US$ 1,675mn during the month to close at US$ 18.76bn as of 30 April 2020, mainly on the back of receipt of US$1.4 bn emergency financing facility from IMF. Also, further assistance from multilateral lending institutions is expected to materialize in near future and a significant portion of debt has been rescheduled by the G20 nations. Consequently, PKR appreciated by 4.1% against USD during the month.

Current Account registered a deficit of only US$ 6mn for Mar’20. In contrast, the current account recorded a deficit of US$ 823mn in Mar’19. Similarly, CAD stood at US$ 2.9bn for 8MFY20, a massive decrease of 72% as compared to same period of last year. The external account situation had improved due to austerity measures and significant PKR devaluation along with the start of Saudi Oil facility from July. Exports during Mar’20 showed a decrease of 10.8% YoY mainly due to lockdown initiated on 23rd March to mitigate local transmission of coronavirus infections. Foreign remittances depicted a significant rise of 9% YoY for Mar’20.

CPI clocked in at an expected level of 8.53% for the month of April’20 due to decrease in food prices, petroleum prices and housing index. We believe inflation levels will fall in the coming months due to decrease in demand and lower energy prices. In light of falling inflation forecasts, the SBP also slashed the discount rate by further 200bps to 9 percent to restrict the economic slowdown and enable timely recovery, leading to a total cut of 425 bps in last two months.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

The central bank decided to cut the policy rate further 200bps to 9%, to tackle economic slowdown anticipated due to COVID19 lockdown. During the period, the central bank was able to raise PKR 1.5 trillion in the two T-bill auctions. Cutoff for 3, 6 and 12M were 8.39%, 7.99% and 7.47% respectively; effectively incorporating approx. 200bps discount from the first T-bill auction of the month in which the cutoffs were 10.89%, 10.30% and 9.64% for 3, 6 and 12M respectively.

In regular cycle PIB auction held on 15th April, the central bank was able to raise PKR 112.7 billion in fixed rate PIBs and PKR 50.3 billion for the 10-Year floating rate PIB. Participation was heavily skewed towards 3-Year PIB which constituted approx. 70% of the total bids received. Cutoffs for 3, 5, 10, 15 and 20 Years were 8.56%, 8.83%, 9%, 10.49% and 10.70% respectively. In the floating rate bond auction, the SBP received bids worth PKR 109.5 billion out of which SBP accepted PKR 50.2 billion at a cutoff price of 102.5594.

On Islamic front, the central bank conducted 5-year variable interest rate GOP ijara sukuk after nearly 2 years (to recall, the last 3-year variable interest rate ijara matured in Dec 18). Overwhelming response was received from the market participants as the total bids were 2.53x times of the auction target; with margin ranging from -75bps to -250bps. Central bank maintained its auction target and only picked up PKR 76.3 billion at the cutoff margin of 125bps under the benchmark rate.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

KSE-100 Index rallied 16.69% during the month of April 2020 to close at 34,111.64 points. The average daily turnover saw a decrease of 9.87% on a MoM basis as it clocked at 161mn in April, compared to previous month’s level of 179mn. Foreigners remained net sellers again, as the net foreign outflow during April '2020 amounted to US$69mn as compared to a net outflow of US$85mn in Mar’2020. Foreign investors remained sellers in all major sectors, led by Commercial Banks (US$ 20.94mn) and Oil & Gas Exploration (US$ 20.15mn).

Reasons for positive performance during the month were; a) emergency cuts of almost 350bps in policy rate by SBP during the month of April to counter the effects of Covid 19 on economy was welcomed by the bourse as highly leveraged sectors like cements and steel remained in limelight and handsomely outperformed the index, b) as WTI hit negative for the first time in history during the month of April 2020, investors grasped the opportunity to enter into stocks benefitting from falling oil and gas prices, resultantly chemical sector also gained investors' interest, while c) receipt of $1.39bn from IMF and commitments from several other multilateral lenders like ADB, World Bank and Islamic Development Bank, inclusion of Pakistan in G20's debt relief plan and indications of easing in lockdown also contributed in increasing investors' confidence.

On a monthly basis, Oil & Gas exploration contributed largest to the upside of KSE-100 index with 1,039 points as international oil prices seen recovery at the end of the month, also because of attractive valuations and a very good results season, followed by Cements with 788 points while Food and personal care contributed negatively to the index by 26 points.

Going forward, macroeconomic fundamentals, how quickly the virus is controlled and resumption of normal business activities will determine market direction in the near term.
