## Economic & Capital Markets Review

### Economic Review & Outlook

Pakistan’s economic growth outlook remains robust due to the current strong growth momentum and upcoming investments in auto and construction industries. Growth is likely to be further helped by greater energy availability. However, in its monetary policy statement issued in May, the Central Bank has commented that the target of 6.2% growth in FY19 may be missed. According to SBP, achieving the ambitious target will depend on managing the external position and keeping inflation within target. Inflation stood at 4.19% in May’18, which is significantly higher than 3.7% reported in April’18. It was, however, still below the consensus expectation of 4.3%. Core (Non-food non-energy) inflation was once again reported at 7.0%, depicting no change from Apr18 level. Due to the inflation and twin deficit outlooks, SBP raised its policy rate by 50bps during the month. Going forward, inflation is expected to settle slightly higher, at around 5.5%-6.0% for FY19, as strong international oil prices coupled with the lagged effect of PKR depreciation will become fully visible in the coming months. Due to the outlook on inflation, market participants expect a further 75bps hike in policy rate in FY19. The external position continued to worsen and the country’s total foreign exchange reserves dipped from USD 17.5bn as at the end of April to USD 16.4bn by the end of May’18. Moreover, the current account deficit worsened in Apr’18 compared to Mar’18 due to reduction in both exports and remittances. The deficit was reported at USD 1.96bn in April, which brought the 10MFY18 deficit to USD 14.04bn, compared to USD 9.35bn in the corresponding period last year. Due to the pressures on the external front, it is expected that PKR will depreciate to PKR 120/USD by Dec’18. Moody’s estimates PKR to depreciate to PKR 125/USD by June 2019.

### Money Market Review & Outlook

During the period under review, yield curve in the secondary market shifted upwards reflecting an expected increase in Discount Rate. Later, the SBP’s monetary policy committee decided to raise the Discount Rate by 50 bps against broad consensus of 25 bps increase. Activity in the secondary market remained mostly concentrated in under 90 days T-Bills. During the period, the central bank was able to fetch approximately PKR 506bn from the two T-Bill auctions, significantly lower than PKR 3.4trn in the previous month. Major participation during both the T-bill auctions was witnessed in 3M followed by 6M; yield for 3M and 6M stood at 6.25% and 6.35% respectively. In order to entice investor’s participation in longer tenure, the central bank for the first time introduced Floating rate bonds, the instrument witnessed overwhelming participation of approximately PKR 174Bn out of which central bank only accepted PKR 20Bn at 50bps above benchmark rate. Going forward, elevated aggregate demand coupled with soaring twin deficits, falling reserves and risk of further currency depreciation pose a greater threat towards near-term macroeconomic stability which may in-turn keep the investors away from long term investments as expectations of further corrective measures in the monetary policy build up.

### Equity Market Review & Outlook

May’18 turned out to be the worst month for equities since Oct’17, as the KSE-100 Index declined by 5.8% amid worsening political and economic environment. Market participation dwindled significantly with average daily volumes in KSE100 declining by 30% MoM to 73mn shares compared to 104mn shares in Apr’18. The lackluster trading activity was attributable to the start of the month of Ramadan. FIPI outflow rose to a 9mth high of US$ 73.2mn, partly due to MSCI rebalancing where heavy selling was witnessed in Banks and Cements. Commercial Banks were the biggest contributors to the Index’s losses followed by Cement and Oil and Gas Marketing Companies. Political uncertainty worsened during the month as Ex-PM Sharif's statement regarding Mumbai attacks in 2008 insinuated Pakistan’s involvement. The negative sentiment was exacerbated by the standstill between the PM and Opposition for appointment of the caretaker PM; just before the decision could move to the Parliament, both parties consented on Justice Nasir-ul-Mulk - a former Chief Justice of Pakistan. The subsequent smooth transition surprised market participants and consequently led to a recovery towards the end of the month. The outgoing government’s hustle in trying to keep some of its promises before its term ended, and the resultant payment to IPPs and Textiles, also contributed to the recovery. With the caretaker government now in place, the next key event in politics remains the General Elections, which are scheduled to be held on 25th July 2018.

The SBP raised policy rate by 50bps to 6.5% in May’18 MPS, citing growing concerns on the external account and core inflation at 7.0% in Apr’18. This followed current account deficit enlarging to US$ 10bn in 10MFY18, up a staggering 1.5x YoY, despite two rounds of PKR depreciation, heavy duties imposed on non-essential imports and a 25bps rate hike in Jan’18. To contain the drawdown in FX reserves, GoP borrowed another US$ 1bn from China, however, at month end SBP’s reserves of US$ 10bn still implies an import cover of just over 2mths.
